       "{'Moderator': ' Good evening from the Health Education Campus of Case Western Reserve University and the Cleveland Clinic. I’m Chris Wallace of Fox News and I welcome you to the first of the 2020 Presidential Debates between President Donald J. Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden. This debate is sponsored by the Commission on Presidential debates. The Commission has designed the format, six roughly 15 minute segments with two minute answers from each candidate to the first question, then open discussion for the rest of each segment. Both campaigns have agreed to these rules. For the record, I decided the topics and the questions in each topic. I can assure you none of the questions has been shared with the Commission or the two candidates. This debate is being conducted under health and safety protocols designed by the Cleveland Clinic, which is serving as the Health Security advisor to the Commission for all four debates. As a precaution, both campaigns have agreed the candidates will not shake hands at the beginning of tonight’s debate. The audience here in the hall has promised to remain silent. No cheers, no boos, or other interruptions so we, and more importantly you, can focus on what the candidates have to say. No noise except right now, as we welcome the Republican nominee, President Trump, and the Democratic nominee Vice President Biden. Gentlemen, a lot of people been waiting for this night, so let’s get going. Our first subject is the Supreme Court. President Trump, you nominated Amy Coney Barrett over the weekend to succeed the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the Court. You say the Constitution is clear about your obligation and the Senate’s to consider a nominee to the Court. Vice President Biden, you say that this is an effort by the President and Republicans to jam through on an appointment in what you call an abuse of power. My first question to both of you tonight, why are you right in the argument you make and your opponent wrong? And where do you think a Justice Barrett would take the court? President Trump, in this first segment, you go first. Two minutes. President Trump, thank you. Same question to you, Vice President Biden. You have two minutes. Gentlemen, we’re now into open discussion. Open discussion, yes, I agree. Go ahead, Vice President. All right, gentlemen, Mr. President. Mr. President. Mr. President, as the moderator, we are going to talk about COVID in the next segment. But go ahead. Well, all right. All right. Let’s talk. We’ve got a lot to unpack here, gentlemen. We’ve got a lot of time. On healthcare, and then we’ll come back to Roe V. Wade. Mr. President, the Supreme Court will hear a case a week after the election in which the Trump Administration, along with 18 state Attorney Generals are seeking to overturn Obamacare, to end Obamacare. You have spent the last week- If I may ask my question, sir. Over the last four years, you have promised to repeal and replace Obamacare, but you have never in these four years come up with a plan, a comprehensive plan, to replace Obamacare. when I finish I’m going to give an opportunity- That’s not a comprehensive place. I didn’t ask, sir. You’re debating him not me. Let me ask my question. Mr. President. Mr. President, I’m the moderator of this debate and I would like you to let me ask my question and then you can answer. You, in the course of these four years, have never come up with a comprehensive plan to replace Obamacare, and just this last Thursday you signed a largely symbolic Executive Order to protect people with pre-existing conditions five days before this debate. So my question, sir, is what is the Trump healthcare plan? What about pre-existing conditions? Okay, like I say, this is open discussion. Sir, you’ll be happy. I’m about to pick up on one of your points to ask the Vice President, which is, he points out that you would like to add a public option to Obamacare. And the argument that he makes and other Republicans make is that that is going to end private insurance. If I start asking the question. And it will end private insurance and create a government takeover of health. Mr. President, can you let him finish, sir? Please let him speak, Mr. President. Mr. President. Gentlemen, you realize if you’re both speaking at the same time. Let the President. Go ahead, sir. I understand that, sir. But I have to give you roughly equal time. Please let the Vice President talk, sir. Please. All right, I have one final question for you. Mr. Vice President, if Senate Republicans, we were talking originally about the Supreme Court here, if Senate Republicans go ahead and confirm Justice Barrett there has been talk about ending the filibuster or even packing the court, adding to the nine justices there. You call this a distraction by the President. But, in fact, it wasn’t brought up by the President. It was brought up by some of your Democratic colleagues in the Congress. So my question to you is, you have refused in the past to talk about it, are you willing to tell the American tonight whether or not you will support either ending the filibuster or packing the court? Gentlemen, I think we’ve ended this- We have ended the segment. We’re going to move on to the second segment. All right, the second subject is COVID-19, which is an awfully serious subject. So let’s try to be serious about it. We have had more than seven million cases of coronavirus in the United States and more than 200,000 people have died. Even after we produce a vaccine, experts say that it could be months or even years before we come back to anything approaching normal. My question for both of you is, based on what you have said and done so far, and what you have said you would do starting in 2021, why should the American people trust you more than your opponent to deal with this public health crisis going forward? In this case, the question goes to you first, sir. Two minutes, uninterrupted. Sir, it’s his two minutes. Wait, wait. You have two minutes, sir. Sir, it’s his two minutes. Sir, you made a point. Let him answer it. So you’re suggesting that the head of your Operation Warp Speed, Dr. Slaoui- He talked about the summer, sir, before it’s generally available, just like Dr. Redfield. I’m talking about when it’s generally available, not- Mr. Vice President, I want to pick up- I want to pick up on this question though. You say the public can trust the scientists, but they can’t trust President Trump. In fact, you said that again tonight. Your running mate, Senator Harris, goes further, saying that public health experts quote, “Will be muzzled, will be suppressed.” Given the fact that polls already show that people are concerned about the vaccine and are reluctant to take it, are you and your running mate, Senator Harris, contributing to that fear? But you’re saying you can’t- Or Senator Harris is saying you can’t trust the scientist. She said that public health experts quote, “Will be muzzled, will be suppressed.” Let him finish. Mr. President? We’ll get to the economy in the next segment, sir. Okay. When it comes to how the virus has been handled so far, the two of you have taken very different approaches, and this is going to affect how the virus is handled going forward by whichever of you ends up becoming the next president. I want to quickly go through several of those. Reopenings. Vice President Biden, you have been much more reluctant than President Trump about reopening the economy and schools. Why, sir? What about this question of reopenings and the fact- All right. I want to move onto another- I want to move onto another subject. I want to move- Gentlemen, I want to move onto another subject. President Trump, you have begun to increasingly question the effectiveness of masks as a disease preventer. And in fact, recently you have cited the issue of waiters touching their masks and touching plates. Are you questioning the efficacy of masks? Okay. Let me ask- Vice President Biden, go ahead, sir. But I was asking you, sir, about masks. Okay. I want to ask you- I want to ask you, we’ve got a little than a minute left in this segment. I want to ask- I want to ask you both about one last subject because your different approaches has even affected the way that you have campaigned. President Trump, you’re holding large rallies with crowds packed together, thousands of people. Outside. Yes, sir. Agreed. Vice President Biden, you are holding much smaller events with- … people with masks. All right. In any case, why you holding the big rallies? Why you not? You go first, sir. But are not worried about us spreading disease? Are you not worried about the disease issues, sir? All right. Do you want to just quickly finish up? Because I want to move on to our next- Gentlemen, can we move on to the- Gentlemen, can we move on to the economy? The economy is, I think it’s fair to say, recovering faster than expected from the shutdown- … in the second quarter. The unemployment rate fell to 8.4% last month. The Federal Reserve says the hit to growth, which is going to be there, is not going to be nearly as big as they had expected. President Trump, you say we are in a V-shaped recovery. Vice President Biden, you say it’s more of a K-shape. What difference does that mean to the American people in terms of the economy? President Trump, in this segment you go first. All right. Your two minutes, sir. We’re now moved to you. As I said, posing the question, the president says it’s a V-shape recovery, you say it’s a K-shaped recovery. What’s the difference? Sir, wait. No. Sir- Yeah, I understand. You’ve agreed to the two minutes, so please let him have it. All right. Your time is up, sir. We are going to get to- Well, you both had two minutes, sir. And so did you. All right. Let’s- Gentlemen, we’re going to get to your economic plans going forward in a moment, but first, Mr. President, as you well know, there’s a new report that in 2016, the year you were elected president, and 2017, your first year as president, that you paid $750 a year in federal income tax each of those years. I know that you pay a lot of other taxes, but I’m asking you this specific question. Is it true that you paid $750 in federal income taxes each of those two years? Sir, I’m asking you a specific question, which is- I understand all of that. I understand all of that- No, Mr. President, I’m asking you a question. Will you tell us how much you paid in federal income taxes in 2016 and 2017? You paid millions of dollars in- So not 750? Vice President Biden, you want to respond? Okay. Gentlemen? Mr. President, we’re talking about the economy. I’d like to ask you about your plans going forward because Mr. Vice President, your economic plan- … if you were to be elected president focuses a lot on big government, big taxes, big spending. I want to focus first on the taxes. You propose more than $4 trillion over a decade in new taxes on individuals making more than $400,000 a year. … on individuals making more than $400,000 a year and on corporations. President Trump says that that kind of an increase in taxes is going to hurt the economy as it’s just coming out of a recession. But respectfully, sir, I’m talking about taxes, not spending. Mr. President- Mr. President, let me pick up on that. You would continue your free market approach, lower taxes, more deregulation, correct? But let me- You talk about the economy booming. It turns out that in Obama’s final three years as president more jobs were created, a million and a half more jobs, than in the first three years of your presidency. Mr. Vice President. Wait, wait, is it fair to say he blew it when, in fact- … when there was record low unemployment before COVID. All right, let him- Mr. Vice President, go ahead. Sir, you’ve asked him a question, let him answer it. Mr. President- Mr. President, please. You’ve asked a question- Mr. President. Mr. President, it’s an open discussion. Please- Well, you have raised an issue, let the Vice President answer. Mr. President- Mr. President, let him answer. . Mr. President, please stop. Go ahead, I’m listening to you. No, no. Go ahead, sir. Go ahead. You get the-  Wait a minute. You get the final word, Mr.- No, no- . Mr. President- That’s the end of the segment. We’re moving on. Vice President- No. The answer to the question is no. Sir- Stop.  Gentlemen, I hate to raise my voice, but I-  Why should I be different than the two of you? So here’s the deal. We have six segments. We have ended that segment. We’re going to go to the next segment. In that segment, you each are going to have two uninterrupted moments. In those two interrupted minutes, Mr. President, you can say anything you want. I’m going to ask a question about race, but if you want to answer about something else, go ahead. But I think that the country would be better served, if we allowed both people to speak with fewer interruptions. I’m appealing to you, sir, to do that. Well, frankly, you’ve been doing more interrupting than he has. Well, sir, less than- No, less than you have. Let’s please continue on. The issue of rice. Vice-President Biden, you say that President Trump’s response to the violence in Charlottesville three years ago, when he talked about very fine people on both sides, was what directly led you to launch this run for president. President Trump, you have often said that you believe you will have done more for Black Americans than any president with the possible exception of Abraham Lincoln. My question for the two of you, is why should voters trust you rather than your opponent to deal with the race issues facing this country over the next four years? Vice President Biden, you go first. It is his- … minute sir. President Trump, you have two minutes. Why should Americans trust you over your opponent to deal race issues? No, no, sir. It’s his two minutes. All right. I want to return to the question of race. Vice President Biden, after the grand jury in the Breonna Taylor case decided not to charge any of the police with homicide, you said it raises the question, “Whether justice could be equally applied in America.” Do you believe that there is a separate but unequal system of justice for Blacks in this country? All right, Mr.- President Trump- President Trump, I’d like to continue with the issue of race. I promise we’re going to get to the issue of law and order in a moment. This month, your administration directed federal agencies to end racial sensitivity training that addresses white privilege or critical race theory. Why did you decide to do that, to end racial sensitivity training? And do you believe that there is systemic racism in this country, sir? What is radical about racial sensitivity training? Vice President Biden. Let him finish. Vice President… I mean, President Trump, sir. You asked a question, let him finish.  Let him answer. All right, we’re done-  Mr. President, you’re going to be very happy because we’re now going to talk about law and order. That’s exactly my question. There has been a dramatic increase in homicides in America this summer particularly, and you often blame that on democratic mayors and democratic governors. But in fact, there have been equivalent spikes in Republican led cities, like Tulsa and Fort Worth. So the question is, is this really a… It’s like Tulsa and Fort worth. So the question is, is this really a party issue? Gentlemen wait a minute. I do want to talk about this issue of law and order though. And in the joint recommendation that came from the Biden-Bernie Sanders task force, you talked about quote re-imagining policing. First of all, what does re-imagining policing mean and do you support? If I might finish the question, what does re-imagining policing mean and do you support the Black Lives Matter call for community control of policing? Now, gentleman. I think I’m going to tell I’m going to take back the bottom line. And I want to get to another subject, which is the issue of protests in many cities that have turned violent in Portland, Oregon, especially we had more than a 100 straight days of protests, which I think you would agree, you talk about peaceful protests. Many of those turned into riots. Mr. Vice-president you say that people who commit crimes should be held accountable. The question I have though is as the democratic nominee, and earlier tonight, you said that you are the Democratic Party right now, have you ever called the Democratic Mayor of Portland or the Democratic Governor of Oregon and said, “Hey, you got to stop this, bring in the National Guard, do whatever it takes, but you’d stop the days and months of violence in Portland.” But you’ve never called for the people… Excuse me, sir. You had never called for the leaders in Portland and in Oregon to call and bring in the National Guard and knock off a 100 days of riots. Go ahead sir. Okay. And to end this, button up this segment I’m going to give you a minute to answer, sir. You have repeatedly criticized… You have repeatedly… You’ve been talking back and forth. I’m asking you. You know sir if you want to switch seats we could very quickly can do that. You have repeatedly criticized the vice president for not specifically calling out Antifa and other left wing extremist groups. But are you willing tonight to condemn white supremacists and militia group and to say that they need to stand down and not add to the violence in a number of these cities as we saw in Kenosha and as we’ve seen in Portland. Are you prepared specifically to do it. But what are you saying? Well, do it, sir. White supremacist and right-wing militia. We’re done, sir. Moving onto the next… All right, gentlemen we’re now moving onto the Trump-Biden record. I’m going to ask a question. When the president seeks a second term, it is generally a referendum on his record but vice president Biden, you’d like to quote one of your dad’s sayings, which is don’t compare me to the almighty, compare me to the alternative. And in this case sir you are the alternative. Looking at both of your records, I’m going to ask each of you. Why should voters elect you president over your opponent in this segment, President Trump you’ll go first, two minutes. Looking at both of your records. Why should voters elect you President as opposed to president Trump, you have two minutes uninterrupted. Wait a minute. Mr. President, your campaign agreed to both sides would get two minute answers, uninterrupted. Well, you’re a side agreed to it and why don’t you observe what your campaign agreed to as a ground rule. Okay, sir? No, that was a rhetorical question. Yes. You may have, go ahead. We’ve already been through this. I think the American people would rather hear about more substantial subjects. Well, as the moderator, sir, I’m going to make a judgment call here. I’d like to talk about climate change. Okay. The forest fires in the West are raging now. They have burned millions of acres. They have displaced hundreds of thousands of people. When state officials there blamed the fires on climate change. Mr. President, you said, I don’t think the science knows. Over your four years, you have pulled the US out of the Paris Climate Accord. You have rolled back a number of Obama Environmental records, what do you believe about the science of climate change and what will you do in the next four years to confront it? What do you believe about the science of climate change, sir? You believe that human pollution, gas, greenhouse gas emissions contributes to the global warming of this planet. But sir if you believe in the science of climate change, why have you rolled back the Obama Clean Power Plan which limited carbon emissions and power plants? Why have you relaxed…? But in the case of California they have simply ignored that. All right, Vice president Biden. I’d like you to respond to the president’s climate change record but I also want to ask you about a concern. You propose $2 trillion in green jobs. You talk about new limits, not abolishing, but new limits on fracking. Ending the use of fossil fuels to generate electricity by 2035 and zero none admission of greenhouse gases by 2050. The president says a lot of these things would tank the economy and cost millions of jobs. What about the argument that President Trump basically says, that you have to balance environmental interests and economic interests? And he’s drawn his line. Let him go for a minute, and then you can go. All right. Let me . Wait a minute, sir. I actually have studied your plan, and it includes upgrading 4 million buildings, weatherizing 2 million homes over four years, building one and a half million energy efficient homes. So the question becomes, the president is saying, I think some people who support the president would say, that sounds like it’s going to cost a lot of money and hurt the economy. Let him finish, sir. All right, gentlemen- Gentlemen- Okay.  Mr. Vice President- Please, sir.  Stop. Stop. Go ahead- Mr. Vice President answered his final question. I’m having a little trouble myself, but… And about the economy and about this question of what it’s going to cost. The Green New Deal and the idea of what your environmental changes will do- So, do you support the Green New Deal? Do you support the- Okay. All right, gentlemen, final segment, election integrity. As we meet tonight, millions of Americans are receiving mail-in ballots or going to vote early. How confident should we be that this will be a fair election, and what are you prepared to do over the next five plus weeks? Because it will not only be to election day, but also counting some mail-in ballots after election day. What are you prepared to do to reassure the American people that the next president will be the legitimate winner of this election. In this final segment, Mr. Vice President, you go first. Mr. President, two minutes. Sir. Two minutes is two minutes. President Trump- You’re going to be able to continue. You have been charging for months that mail-in balloting is going to be a disaster. You say it’s rigged , that it’s going to lead to fraud. But in 2018, in the last midterm election, 31 million people voted mail-in voting. That was more than a quarter of all the voters that year, cast their ballots by mail. Now that millions of mail-in ballots have gone out, what are you going to do about it? And are you counting on the Supreme Court, including a Justice Barrett, to settle any dispute? But what are you going to do about it- There are millions of ballots going out right now. What are you going to do- No. No. I know your complaint . I’m asking you about the fact that millions of people have received- No. But what I’m saying is , what are you going to do about the fact that millions of people- Okay. Vice President Biden, in fact, go ahead, sir- I want to continue with you on this  Vice President Biden- No. Excuse me. Vice President Biden, the biggest problem, in fact, over the years with mail-in voting has not been fraud, historically. It has been that sizable numbers, sometimes hundreds of thousands of ballots are thrown out because they have not been properly filled out, or there is some other irregularity, or they missed  the deadline. So the question I have is, are you concerned that the Supreme Court with a Justice Barrett will settle any dispute? All right. No. No. No. I have a final . Gentlemen, I have a final question - We can keep talking. In eight states,  election workers are prohibited, currently by law, eight states, from even beginning to process ballots, even take them out of the envelopes and flatten them until election day. That means that it’s likely, because there’s going to be a huge increase in mail-in balloting, that we are not going to know on election night who the winner is, that it could be days. It could be weeks- … until we find out who the new president is. First for you, sir. Finally, for the vice president, and I hope neither of you will interrupt the other. Will you urge your supporters to stay calm during this extended period, not to engage in any civil unrest? And will you pledge tonight that you will not declare victory until the election has been independently certified? President Trump, you go first- You’re urging them what? What does that mean, not go along- Does that mean you’re going to tell your people- … to take to the streets? And what would you do about that? Vice President Biden- Vice President Biden, final question for you. Will you urge your supporters to stay calm while the vote is counted? And will you pledge not to declare victory until the election is independently certified? I asked you. You had an opportunity to respond . Go ahead . Vice President Biden, go ahead. Gentlemen, just say that’s the end of it . This is the end of this debate- We’re going to leave it there- … to be continued in more debates as we go on. President Trump, Vice President Biden, it’s been an interesting hour and a half. I want to thank you both for participating in the first of three debates that you have agreed to engage in. We want to thank Case Western Reserve University and the Cleveland Clinic for hosting this event. The next debate, sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates, will be one week from tomorrow, October 7th, at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. The two vice presidential nominees, Vice President Mike Pence and Senator Kamala Harris will debate at 9:00 PM Eastern that night. We hope you watch. Until then, thank you, and good night. Thank you. -offs and thousands of others could lose their jobs soon. Race relations are at an all time low. These are the dark days that we have ever experienced. But, there’s a light at the end of the tunnel, a chance to turn things around and get our country back where it belongs. It will happen one month from today on November 3rd when we have a chance to elect a man who has always been with us, a working class guy from Scranton, Pennsylvania, who will restore decency and honesty to the White House. It is my great honor to introduce the next President of the United States of America, my friend, Joe Biden. Thank you, Vice President. Yes, we have two questions. The first question is, for transit workers, the current President’s failure to manage COVID-19 crisis has cost our members their lives. As mentioned, we have lost 89 ATU brothers and sisters to this horrible virus. A recent ATU survey found that 50% of employers have not provided bus operators with the basic personal protection equipment, PPE like masks and gloves. Without federal government help, transit agencies have been forced to bid against each other for PPE. And as a result, securing the lifesaving equipment has been difficult. The President has said that the federal government is not a shipping clerk. It’s every state and every transit agency for themselves. Defying all common sense, the first few critical weeks of this pandemic, Trump’s Department of Transportation remarkably said on its website that PPE is not recommended at this time. Even now after the CDC recommended wearing face covering in a public setting where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain, the DLT has still not mandated masks on transit vehicles. So my question is, as a result, passengers with Coronavirus keep getting on the bus, infecting other passengers and transit workers, and there is no end in sight. So, how would you handle things differently? Thank you, Mr. President, Vice President. You kind of touched on, Joe, my second question. And that is, what is your plan to save transportation services in this country? Transit systems are running out of money. School bus contractors and motor coach companies are going out of business. Right now, we are facing layoffs all across the country. And the safety situation on the bus right now is terrible. Our members, they serve as mass police. regulations while trying to drive a bus at the same time. Even before the pandemic, our ATU brothers and sisters had been getting attacked behind the wheel. Slapped. They get punched, spit on, held up at gunpoint, and stabbed. So Joe, I know you had brought a little bit of this up. We’ve been fighting for safe buses and the industry to make changes, but what are your thoughts on these transport … What are your thoughts on these, and transportation funding on safety issues? Yes. Mr. Vice President, you didn’t go on too long. Actually, it was great to hear someone that gets it and someone that actually felt like they know our job. I haven’t heard that in a long time. Thank you, and I just wanted to say some closing remarks. Vice President Biden, thank you for joining us today. Our members learned a lot about your views on the key issues that matter most to them. We hope you will stay safe and healthy and go on to win back this country. Brothers and sisters, thank you for joining us today for this special event. Early voting has already begun in many states. If you’re going out to the polls, be safe. If you are voting by mail, get your ballot in. Despite what you are hearing from the other side, voting by mail is totally fine. However you do it, just vote. Vote as if your job is on a line because it is. Vote as if your health is on a line because it is. Vote as if our way of life is on the line because it is. Get out and vote for this courageous, honest, and decent man who will lead our country back from the brink, Joe Biden. Thank you. Thank you, Joe. And have a good evening. Thank you everybody. Be safe. Brothers and sisters, I hope you enjoyed. Please vote. We need to change this.',\n",
       " 'Biden': \" How you doing, man? I’m well. Well, first of all, thank you for doing this and looking forward to this, Mr. President. The American people have a right to have a say in who the Supreme Court nominee is and that say occurs when they vote for United States Senators and when they vote for the President of United States. They’re not going to get that chance now because we’re in the middle of an election already. The election has already started. Tens of thousands of people already voted and so the thing that should happen is we should wait. We should wait and see what the outcome of this election is because that’s the only way the American people get to express their view is by who they elect as President and who they elect as Vice President. Now, what’s at stake here is the President’s made it clear, he wants to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. He’s been running on that, he ran on that and he’s been governing on that. He’s in the Supreme Court right now trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, which will strip 20 million people from having health insurance now, if it goes into court. And the justice, I’m not opposed to the justice, she seems like a very fine person. But she’s written, before she went in the bench, which is her right, that she thinks that the Affordable Care Act is not Constitutional. The other thing that’s on the court, and if it’s struck down, what happens? Women’s rights are fundamentally changed. Once again, a woman could pay more money because she has a pre-existing condition of pregnancy. They’re able to charge women more for the same exact procedure a man gets. And that ended when we, in fact, passed the Affordable Care Act, and there’s a hundred million people who have pre-existing conditions and they’ll be taken away as well. Those pre-existing conditions, insurance companies are going to love this. And so it’s just not appropriate to do this before this election. If he wins the election and the Senate is Republican, then he goes forward. If not, we should wait until February. He’s elected to the next election. That’s simply not true. Open discussion. Number one, he knows what I proposed. What I proposed is that we expand Obamacare and we increase it. We do not wipe any. And one of the big debates we had with 23 of my colleagues trying to win the nomination that I won, were saying that Biden wanted to allow people to have private insurance still. They can. They do. They will under my proposal. That is simply a lie. The party is me. Right now, I am the Democratic Party. I am the Democratic Party right now. The platform of the Democratic Party is what I, in fact, approved of, what I approved of. Now, here’s the deal. The deal is that it’s going to wipe out pre-existing conditions. And, by the way, the 20, the 200 mil- the 200,000 people that have died on his watch, how many of those have survived? Well, there’s seven million people that contracted COVID. What does it mean for them going forward if you strike down the Affordable Care Act? I’m happy to talk about this. You’re not going to be able to shut him up. Let me finish. The point is that the President also is opposed to Roe V. Wade. That’s on the ballot as well and the court, in the court, and so that’s also at stake right now. And so the election is all- It’s on the ballot in the court. In the court. Donald would you just be quiet for a minute. All right. Good healthcare. He has not done healthcare. Yes. It is not. It does not. It’s only for those people who are so poor they qualify for Medicaid they can get that free in most States, except Governors who want to deny people who are poor Medicaid. Anyone who qualifies for Medicare, excuse me, Medicaid would automatically be enrolled in the public option. The vast majority of the American people would still not be in that option. Number one. Number two. Look, hey. I’m not going to listen to him. The fact of the matter is I beat Bernie Sanders. I beat him by a whole hell of a lot. I’m here standing facing you, old buddy. All he knows how to do- Look he’s the deal. I got very lucky. I’m going to get very lucky tonight as well. And tonight I’m going to make sure. Because here’s the deal, here’s the deal. The fact is that everything he’s saying so far is simply a lie. I’m not here to call out his lies. Everybody knows he’s a liar. God, I want to make sure- No, he doesn’t know how to do that. The wrong guy, the wrong night, at the wrong time. There is no manifesto, number one. Number two. Number two. I’ll tell you what, he is not for any help for people needing healthcare. Because he, in fact, already has costs 10 million people their healthcare that they had from their employers because of his recession. Number one. Number two, there are 20 million people getting healthcare through Obamacare now that he wants to take it away. He won’t ever look you in the eye and say that’s what he wants to do. Take it away. He doesn’t know how. He doesn’t know how to do that. He has never offered a plan. He has no plan for healthcare. He sends out wishful thinking. He has Executive Orders that have no power. He hasn’t lowered drug costs for anybody. He’s been promising a healthcare plan since he got elected. He has none, like almost everything else he talks about. He does not have a plan. He doesn’t have a plan. And the fact is this man doesn’t know what he’s talking about. . Sure. Whatever position I take on that, that’ll become the issue. The issue is the American people should speak. You should go out and vote. You’re voting now. Vote and let your Senators know strongly how you feel. Vote now. Make sure you, in fact, let people know, your Senators. I’m not going to answer the question. Will you shut up, man? This is so un-Presidential. That was really a productive segment, wasn’t it? Keep yapping, man. They sure do. Good luck. 200,000 dead. As you said, over seven million infected in the United States. We, in fact, have 4% of the world’s population, 20% of the deaths. 40,000 people a day are contracting COVID. In addition to that, about between 750 and 1000 people a day are dying. When he was presented with that number, he said, “It is what it is.” Well, it is what it is because you are who you are. That’s why it is. The President has no plan. He hasn’t laid out anything. He knew all the way back in February how serious this crisis was. He knew it was a deadly disease. What did he do? He’s on tape as acknowledging he knew it. He said he didn’t tell us or give people a warning of it because he didn’t want to panic the American people. You don’t panic. He panicked. In addition to that, what did he do? He went in and we were insisting that the people we had in the ground in China should be able to go to Wuhan and determine for themselves how dangerous this was. He did not even ask Xi to do that. He told us what a great job Xi was doing. He said we owe him debt of gratitude for being so transparent with us. And what did he do then? He then did nothing. He waited and waited and waited. He still doesn’t have a plan. I laid out back in March, exactly what we should be doing. And I laid out again in July, what we should be doing. We should be providing all the protective gear possible. We should be providing the money the House has passed in order to be able to go out and get people the help they need to keep their businesses open. Open schools cost a lot of money. You should get out of your bunker and get out of the sand trap in your golf course and go in the Oval Office and bring together the Democrats and Republicans and fund what needs to be done now to save lives. I know how to do the job. I know how to get the job done. 14,000 people died, not 200,000. And there was no one … We didn’t shut down the economy. This is his economy he shut down. The reason it’s shut down is because, look, you folks at home. How many of you got up this morning and had an empty chair at the kitchen table because someone died of COVID? How many of you are in a situation where you lost your mom or dad and you couldn’t even speak to them, you had a nurse holding a phone up so you could in fact say goodbye? His own CDC Director says we could lose as many as another 200,000 people between now and the end of the year. And he said, if we just wear a mask, we can save half those numbers. Just a mask. And by the way, in terms of the whole notion of a vaccine, we’re for a vaccine, but I don’t trust him at all. Nor do you. I know you don’t. What we trust is a scientist. God. This is the same man who told you- … by Easter, this would be gone away. By the warm weather, it’d be gone. Miraculous, like a miracle. And by the way, maybe you could inject some bleach in your arm, and that would take care of it. This is the same man. So here’s the deal. This man is talking about a vaccine. Every serious company is talking about maybe having a vaccine done by the end of the year, but the distribution of that vaccine will not occur until sometime beginning of the middle of next year to get it out, if we get the vaccine. And pray God we will. Pray God we will. No more than the question you just asked him. You pointed out he puts pressure and disagrees with his own scientists. Everybody knows- Well, no, no. You can trust the scientist. She didn’t say that. You can trust the- Yes. Well, that’s what he’s going to try to do, but there’s thousands of scientists out there, like here at this great hospital that don’t work for him. Their job doesn’t depend on him. They’re the people… And by the way- By the way- Do you believe for a moment what he’s telling you in light of all the lies he’s told you about the whole issue relating to COVID? He still hasn’t even acknowledged that he knew this was happening, knew how dangerous it was going to be back in February, and he didn’t even tell you. He’s on record as saying it. He panicked or he just looked at the stock market. One of the two. Because guess what? A lot of people died and a lot more are going to die unless he gets a lot smarter, a lot quicker- Oh, give me a break. Well, let’s have this debate- Because he doesn’t have a plan. If I were running it, I’d know what the plan is. You’ve got to provide these businesses the ability to have the money to be able to reopen with the PPE, as well as with the sanitation they need. You have to provide them classic- Will he just shush for a minute? Nancy Pelosi and Schumer, they have a plan. He won’t even meet with them. The Republicans won’t meet in the Senate. He sits in his golf course. Well, I mean, literally, think about it. Think about it. You just admitted you’d shut it down. I got to respond to that. I got to respond to that. Just like your rally. Look, the way to open businesses is give them the wherewithal to be able open. We provided money, the- Well, masks make a big difference. His own head of the CDC said if we just wore masks between now, if everybody wore a mask and social distanced between now and January, we’d probably save up to 100,000 lives. It matters. It matters. No serious person has said the opposite. No serious person. He did not say the opposite. By the way, did you see one of the last big rallies he had? A reporter came up to him to ask him a question, he said, “No, no, no. Stand back, put on your mask, put on a mask. Have you been tested? I’m way far away from those other people.” That’s what he said, “I’m going to be okay.” He’s not worried about you. He’s not worried about the people out there . No negative effect. Come on. Yes, I would. He’s been totally irresponsible the way in which he has handled the social distancing and people wearing masks, basically encouraged them not to. He’s a fool on this. The difference is millionaires and billionaires like him in the middle of the COVID crisis have done very well. Billionaires have made another $300 billion because of his profligate tax proposal, and he only focused on the market. But you folks at home, you folks living in Scranton and Claymont and all the small towns and working class towns in America, how well are you doing? This guy paid a total of $750 in taxes. Do I get my time back? The fact is that he has in fact, worked on this in a way that he’s going to be the first president of the United States to leave office, having fewer jobs in his administration than when he became president. Fewer jobs than when he became president. First one in American history. Secondly, the people who have lost their jobs are those people who have been on the front lines. Those people who have been saving our lives, those people who have been out there dying. People who’ve been putting themselves in the way to make sure that we could all try to make it. And the idea that he is insisting that we go forward and open when you have almost half the states in America with a significant increase in COVID deaths and COVID cases in the United States of America, and he wants to open it up more. Why is he want to open it up? Why does he take care of the… You can’t fix the economy until you fix the COVID crisis. And he has no intention of doing anything about making it better for you all at home in terms of your health and your safety. Schools. Why aren’t schools open? Because it costs a lot of money to open them safely. They were going to give, his administration going to give the teachers and school students masks, and then they decided no, couldn’t do that because it’s not a national emergency. Not a national emergency. They’ve done nothing to help small businesses. Nothing. They’re closing. One in six is now gone. He ought to get on the job and take care of the needs of the American people so we can open safely. People want to be safe. People want to be safe. Show us your tax returns. Show us your tax returns. Release your tax return. When? Inshallah? In ? Yeah, I do want to respond. Look, the tax code that put him in a position that he pays less tax than on the money a school teacher makes is because of him… He says he’s smart because he can take advantage of the tax code. And he does take advantage of the tax code. That’s why I’m going to eliminate the Trump tax cuts. And I’m going to eliminate those tax cuts. And make sure that we invest in the people who in fact need the help. People out there need help. Because you weren’t president- Because you weren’t president and screwing things up. You’re the worst president America has ever had. Come on. Well, just take a look at what is the analysis done by Wall Street firms, points out that my economic plan would create 7 million more jobs than his in four years, number one. And number two, it would create an additional $1 trillion in economic growth, because it would be about buying American. The federal government spends $600 billion a year on everything from ships, to steel, to buildings and the like. And under my proposal, we’re going to make sure that every penny of that has to be made by a company- By the way, I’m going to eliminate a significant number of the taxes. I’m going to make the corporate tax 28%. It shouldn’t be 21%. You have 91 companies federal, I mean, the fortune 500, who don’t pay a single penny in tax making billions of dollars. Because you in fact passed that, that was your tax proposal. Yeah, you got it done- The economy- Let me finish. Not lower tax for the American people. Look- … we inherited the worst recession, short of a depression in American history. I was asked to bring it back. We were able to have an economic recovery that created the jobs you’re talking about. We handed him a booming economy, he blew it. He blew it. Yeah, because what he did, even before COVID, manufacturing went in the hole. Manufacturing went in a hole- … number one. Number two- Number three. No. This guy- We did not. I’m the guy that brought back the automobile industry. I was asked to bring back Chrysler and General Motors. He brought them back right here in the state of Ohio and Michigan. He blew it. They’re gone. He blew it. And in fact, they’re gone- That is not true. And so you take a look at what he’s actually done. He’s done very little. His trade deals are the same way. He talks about these great trade deals. He talks about the art of the deal. China’s perfected the art of the steel. We have a higher deficit with China now than we did before. We have the highest trade deficit- … with Mexico. That is not true. None of that is true. None of that is true. Is totally- Totally discredited. Totally discredited. And by the way- Mr. Vice- That is not true. It is not a fact. It’s been totally discredited. My son did nothing wrong at Barisma- He doesn’t want to let me answer, because he knows I have the truth. His position has been totally thoroughly discredited- And you can- by everybody. Well, by the media, by our allies. By the World Bank- By everyone, has discredited. And matter of fact  Matter of fact- Even the people who testified under oath- Even the people under- … testified under oath in his administration said I did my job and I did it very well. I did it honorably. Well, I’ll give you the list of the people who- I’m sure that you’ve already fired most of them, because they did a good job. Well, here’s the- Well, it’s hard to get any word in with this clown. Excuse me, this person. No, no. Mr. President- That is simply not true. Look, here’s the deal. We want to talk about families and ethics. I don’t want to do that. I mean, his family, we could talk about all night. His family’s already- And that’s such a- This is not about my family or his family. It’s about your family, the American people.  That’s not true. It doesn’t want to talk about what you need. You, the American people, it’s about you. That’s what we’re talking about here. He didn’t take that. Try to be honest. That is absolutely not true. That’s a good point. It’s about equity and equality. It’s about decency. It’s about the constitution. And we have never walked away from trying to require equity for everyone, equality for the whole of America. But we’ve never accomplished it, but we’ve never walked away from it like he has done. It is true, the reason I got in the race is when those people… Close your eyes, remember what those people look like coming out of the fields, carrying torches, their veins bulging, just spewing anti-Semitic bile and accompanied by the Ku Klux Klan. A young woman got killed and they asked the president what he thought. He said, “There were very fine people on both sides.” No president’s ever said anything like that. . Now- … second point I’d make to you, is that when Floyd was killed, when Mr. Floyd was killed, there was a peaceful protest in front of the White House. What did he do? He came out of his bunker, had the military use tear gas on them so he could walk across to a church and hold up a Bible. And then what happened after that? The Bishop of that very church said that it was a disgrace. The general who was with him said all he ever wants to do is divide people, not unite people at all. This is a president who has used everything as a dog whistle, to try to generate racists hatred, racist division. This is a man who, in fact, you talk about helping African-Americans, one in 1000 African Americans has been killed because of the coronavirus. And if he doesn’t do something quickly, by the end of the year, one in 500 will have been killed. One in 500 African Americans. This man is as a savior of African-Americans? This man cares at all? This man’s done virtually nothing. Look, the fact is that you have to look at what he talks about. You have to look at what he did. And what he did has been disastrous for the African-American community. I’ve never said- Yes, there is. There’s systemic injustice in this country, in education and work and in law enforcement and the way in which it’s enforced. But look, the vast majority of police officers are good, decent, honorable men and women. They risk their lives every day to take care of us, but there are some bad apples. And when they occur, when they find them, they have to be sorted out. They have to be held accountable. They have to be held accountable. And what I’m going to do as President of the United States is call together an entire group of people at the White House, everything from the civil rights groups, to the police officers, to the police chiefs, and we’re going to work this out. We’re going to work this out. So we changed the way in which we have more transparency, in when these things happen. These cops aren’t happy to see what happened to George Floyd. These cops aren’t happy to see what happened to Breonna Taylor. Most don’t like it, but we have to have a system where people are held accountable when… And by the way, violence in response is never appropriate, never appropriate. Peaceful protest is, violence is never appropriate. That is not peaceful protest. Nobody’s doing that. He’s the racist. Here’s the deal. I know a lot more about this- . The fact is that there is racial insensitivity. People have to be made aware of what other people feel like, what insults them, what is demeaning to them. It’s important people know. Many people don’t want to hurt other people’s feelings, but it makes a big difference. It makes a gigantic difference in the way a child is able to grow up and have a sense of self-esteem. It’s a little bit like how this guy and his friends look down on so many people. They look down their nose on people like Irish Catholics, like me, who grow up in Scranton. They look down on people who don’t have money. They look down on people who are of a different faith. They looked down on people who are a different color. In fact, we’re all Americans. The only way we’re going to bring this country together is bring everybody together. There’s nothing we cannot do, if we do it together. We can take this on and we can defeat racism in American. Oh my Lord. This is ridiculous. Absolutely ridiculous. Violent crime- I’m in favor of law. You- . Law and order with justice, where people get treated fairly. And the fact of the matter is, violent crime went down 17%, 15% in our administration. It’s gone up on his watch. He wouldn’t know a suburb unless you took a wrong turn. I was raised in the suburbs. This is not 1950. All these dog whistles and racism don’t work anymore. Suburbs are by and large integrated. There’s many people today driving their kids to soccer practice and/or black and white and Hispanic in the same car as there have been any time in the past, what really is a threat to the suburbs and their safety is his failure to deal with COVID. They’re dying in the suburbs. His failure to deal with the environment, they’re being flooded, they’re being burned out because his refusal to do anything. That’s why the suburbs are in trouble. Look, what I support are the police having the opportunity to deal with the problems they face and I’m totally opposed to defunding the police offices. As a matter of fact police, local police, the only one defunding in his budget calls for a $400 million cut in local law enforcement assistance. They need more assistance. They need when they show up for a 9-11 call to have someone with them as a psychologist or psychiatrist to keep them from having to use force and be able to talk people down. We have to have community policing like we had before where the officers get to know the people in the communities. That’s when crime went down, it didn’t go up. It went down. And so we have to be… That is not true. That’s not true. We don’t have time to do anything. I don’t hold public office. Now I am a former vice president. I’ve made it clear. I’ve made it clear in my public statements that the violence should be prosecuted. It should be prosecuted and anyone who committed it should be prosecuted. They can in fact take care of it if he just stay out of the way. And by the way his own former spokesperson said, “Riots and chaos and violence help he cause.” That’s what this is all about. I do. I think Kellyanne Conway. She said that. Here’s the point, the point is that that’s why he keeps trying to rile everything up. He doesn’t want to calm things down instead of going in and talking to people and saying, “Let’s get everybody together. Figure out how to deal with this.” What’s he do? He just pours gasoline in the fire constantly and every single solitary time. Say it, do it say it. Proud Boys. His own FBI Director said unlike white supremacist, Antifa is an idea not an organization- … not a militia. That’s what his FBI Director said. Every body in your administration tells you the truth, it’s a bad idea. You have no idea about anything. Under this president, we become weaker, sicker, poor, more divided and more violent. When I was vice president, we inherited a recession. I was asked to fix it. I did. We left him a booming economy and he caused the recession. With regard to being weaker, the fact is that I’ve gone head to head with Putin and made it clear to him we’re not going to take any of his stuff. He’s Putin’s puppy. He still refuses to even say anything to Putin about the bounty on the heads of American soldiers. By the way, my son… He never keeps his word. Can you get back 30 seconds? So thirdly, we’re poor. The billionaires have gotten much more wealthy by a tune of over $3- $400 billion more just since COVID. You in the home, you got less you’re in more trouble than you were before. In terms of being more violent. When we were in office there were 15% less violence in America than there is today. He’s President United States. It’s on his watch. And with regard to more divided the nation, it can’t stay divided. We can’t be this way. And speaking of my son, the way you talk about the military, the way you talk about them being losers and being and just being suckers. My son was in Iraq. He spent a year there. He got the Brown Star. He got the Conspicuous Service Medal. He was not a loser. He was a Patriot and the people left behind there were heroes. And I resent- I’m talking about my son, Beau Biden, you’re talking about Hunter? That’s not true he was not dishonorably discharged. None of that is true. That is not true. My son like a lot of people at home had a drug problem. He’s overtaking it. He’s fixed it. He’s worked on it. And I’m proud of him, I’m proud of my son. He wasn’t given tens of millions of dollars.  It was all discredited. That is not true. That report is totally discredited. Mitt Romney on that committee said it wasn’t worth taxpayer’s money. That report was written for political reason. So would I. Why have you relaxed fuel economy standards that are going to create more pollution from cars and trucks? He’s absolutely wrong, number one. Number two, if in fact, during our administration in the recovery act, I was in charge able to bring down the cost of renewable energy to cheaper than are as cheap as coal and gas and oil. Nobody’s going to build another coal fired plant in America. No one’s going to build another oil fire plant in America. They’re going to move to renewable energy. Number one, number two, we’re going to make sure that we are able to take the federal fleet and turn it into a fleet that’s run on their electric vehicles. Making sure that we can do that, we’re going to put 500,000 charging stations in all of the highways that we’re going to be building in the future. We’re going to build a economy that in fact is going to provide for the ability of us to take 4 million buildings and make sure that they in fact are weatherized in a way that in fact will they’ll emit significantly less gas and oil because the heat will not be going out. There’s so many things that we can do… Gas and oil because the heat will not be going out. There’s so many things that we can do now to create thousands and thousands of jobs. We can get to net zero, in terms of energy production, by 2035. Not only not costing people jobs, creating jobs, creating millions of good-paying jobs. Not 15 bucks an hour, but prevailing wage, by having a new infrastructure that in fact, is green. And the first thing I will do, I will rejoin the Paris Accord. I will join the Paris Accord because with us out of it, look what’s happening. It’s all falling apart. And talk about someone who has no relationship with foreign policy. The rainforests of Brazil are being torn down, are being ripped down. More carbon is absorbed in that rainforest than every bit of carbon that’s emitted in the United States. Instead of doing something about that, I would be gathering up and making sure we had the countries of the world coming up with $20 billion, and say, “Here’s $20 billion. Stop tearing down the forest. And If you don’t, then you’re going to have significant economic consequences.” Well, he hasn’t drawn a line. He wants to make sure that methane’s not a problem. You can now emit more methane without it being a problem. Methane. This is a guy who says that you don’t have to have mileage standards for automobiles that exist now. This is the guy who says that, the fact that- It’s all true. And here’s the deal- I’m talking about the Biden plan - No. That is not- Not true- Not true. Not true. Simply… Look- That is simply not the case- What it’s going to do, it’s going to create thousands and millions of jobs. Good paying jobs . He doesn’t know how to do that- The fact is, it’s going to create millions of good paying jobs, and these tax incentives for people to weatherize, which he wants to get rid of. It’s going to make the economy much safer. Look how much we’re paying now to deal with the hurricanes, deal with… By the way, he has an answer for hurricanes. He said, maybe we should drop a nuclear weapon on them, and they may- Yeah, he did say that- And here’s the deal- … we’re going to be in a position where we can create hard, hard, good jobs by making sure the environment is clean, and we all are in better shape. We spend billions of dollars now, billions of dollars, on floods, hurricanes, rising seas. We’re in real trouble. Look what’s happened just in the Midwest with these storms that come through and wipe out entire sections and counties in Iowa. They didn’t happen before. They’re because of global warming. We make up 15% of the world’s problem. But the rest of the world, we’ve got to get them to come along. That’s why we have to get back into the Paris Accord. For 47- That is not my plan . The Green New Deal  is not my plan. - I did not say that- Play it. Play it- The final question is, I can’t remember which of all his rantings . Yeah. The economy- The Green New Deal will pay for itself as we move forward. We’re not going to build plants that, in fact, are great polluting plants- Pardon me? No, I don’t support the Green New Deal. I support - I support  the Biden plan that I put forward. The Biden plan, which is different than what he calls the radical Green New Deal. Prepare to let people vote. They should go to iwillvote.com, decide how they’re going to vote, when they’re going to vote, and what means by which they’re going to vote. His own Homeland Security director, and as well as the FBI director, says that there is no evidence at all that mail-in ballots are a source of being manipulated and cheating. They said that. The fact is that there are going to be millions of people because of COVID that are going to be voting by mail-in ballots like he does, by the way. He sits behind the Resolute Desk and sends his ballot to Florida, number one. Number two, we’re going to make sure that those people who want to vote in person are able to vote because there are enough poll watchers are there to make sure they can socially distance. The polls are open on time, and the polls stay open until the votes are counted. And this is all about trying to dissuade people from voting because he’s trying to scare people into thinking that it’s not going to be legitimate. Show up and vote. You will determine the outcome of this election. Vote, vote, vote. If you’re able to vote early in your state, vote early. If you’re able to vote in person, vote in person. Vote whatever way is the best way for you, because you will… He cannot stop you from being able to determine the outcome of this election. And in terms of whether or not… When the votes are counted and they’re all counted, that will be accepted. If I win, that will be accepted. If I lose, that’ll be accepted. But by the way, if in fact he says, he’s not sure what he’s going to accept. Well, let me tell you something, it doesn’t matter, because if we get the votes, it’s going to be all over. He’s going to go. He can’t stay in power. It won’t happen. It won’t happen, so vote. Just make sure you understand, you have it in your control to determine what this country is going to look like the next four years. Is it going to change, or are you going to get four more years of these lies? There is no … There is no evidence of that- There is no evidence of that- Five states have had mail-in ballots for the last decade or more. Five, including two Republican states. And you don’t have to solicit the ballot. It’s sent to you. It’s sent to your home. What they’re saying is that it has to be a postmark by election day. If it doesn’t get in until the seventh, eighth, ninth, it still should be counted. He’s just afraid of counting the votes- I am concerned that any court would settle this, because here’s the deal. When you get a ballot and you fill it out, you’re supposed to have an affidavit. If you didn’t know, you have someone say that, this is me. You should be able to, if in fact you can verify that’s you before the ballot is thrown out, that’s sufficient to be able to count the ballot because someone made a mistake and not dotting the correct I. Who they voted for, testify, say who they voted for, say it’s you. That is totally legitimate. Mail service delivers  185 million pieces of mail a day - Yes. And here’s the deal. We count the ballots, as you pointed out. Some of these ballots in some states can’t even be opened until election day. And if there’s thousands of ballots, it’s going to take time to do it. And by the way, our military… They’ve been voting by ballots since the end of the Civil War, in effect. And that’s what’s going to happen. Why is it, for them, somehow not fraudulent. It’s the same process. It’s honest. No one has established at all that there is fraud related to mail-in ballots, that somehow it’s a fraudulent process. He has no idea what he’s talking about. Here’s the deal. The fact is, I will accept it, and he will too. You know why? Because once the winner is declared after all the ballots are counted, all the votes are counted, that’ll be the end of it. That’ll be the end of it. And if it’s me, in fact, fine. If it’s not me, I’ll support the outcome. And I’ll be a president, not just for the Democrats. I’ll be a president for Democrats and Republicans. And this guy- Hey everybody. I have to tell y’all, it’s great to see you. Hello Cleveland. Don’t jump. Folks, I was reminiscing as we drove to the station, I spent the bulk of my adult life driving to an Amtrak station. I commuted every day from Wilmington, Delaware to Washington DC when I got elected as a young Senator, right after my wife and daughter were killed, and I didn’t plan on staying in the Senate, but I agreed I’d stay for six months, a long time ago, and I started commuting and the fact is they tell me I’ve logged more than 2,100,000 miles on Amtrak. So it’s good to be here. It’s not as fast as the helicopter, but I made a lot of family and friends on Amtrak. So I’m looking forward to getting on the train with you guys. I want to start off by saying that it’s great to be in Ohio and with my so many friends, members of Congress, local elected officials. It’s an honor to be here with Tiffany. I know how hard it is for her. And I say I know, I was in the position of her children. My dad went through the same thing, Mr. Mayor. Back in Scranton, Pennsylvania, he lost his job. And I remember him walking up the stairs, making what I call that longest walk a parent has to make to tell a child that he’s going to have to leave. My dad didn’t have an eight hour ride. He only had a three hour ride, three and a half hour ride. He moved to Wilmington, Delaware. Took a couple of years before he could bring us back down to Delaware, come home every weekend, but to make sure that we’re all together again. It’s a hard slog. A lot of people have made that. And Tiffany, you’re a wonderful, wonderful mother, teacher, and the way you talk about your husband, he and I have something in common. We both married way up. I want to say that my dad, when he was, I apologize to Congressman Lamb, he’s heard me say this a lot, but my dad, when we moved back to Delaware, moved to Delaware, would say all the time to his children, my siblings and I, he’d say, “Joey, a job’s about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about your dignity. It’s about respect. It’s about being able to hold your head up. It’s being able to look your child in the eye and say, it’s going to be okay. That’s what a job is about.” And Tiffany, when I think about your husband taking that job eight hours away, although it’s a hundred years ago, I think about my dad, and I imagine your husband has the same stamina, and you do, as my mom and dad did. The fact is that last night’s debate, and this election, is supposed to be about you, Tiffany, about you and all the people I grew up with in Scranton, and people in Youngstown, and Claymont, Delaware, and all the people who make a difference. Does any President, does your President understand at all what you’re going through, what so many other people are going through? Question is does he see you where you are and where you want to be? Does he care? As he tried to walk in your shoes, to understand what’s going on in your life? Or does he just ignore you and all the folks all over America who are in a similar situation? I think he’s more than ignoring us. I look at things from Scranton’s perspective, he looks at from Park Avenue. I think he basically looks down on us. He judges us. The fact is that I think that when he called our military, and I see we got some veterans here too, thank you for your service man, but when he called our veterans who lost their lives and served suckers and losers, I thought it was one of the most despicable things that I’ve ever heard a President say. Guys you are soldiers or a veteran, you served your country, like you did, like you did Connor, like my son did. What he does, he lies to you. He lies to you about exactly what’s happened. Does he lie to you when, like this president did to your husband, that all the workers at GM plant in Lordstown were going to be in good shape. You remember what he said? And you said it to me, he said, “Don’t move. Don’t sell your house because no Ohio factory will shut down in Donald Trump’s America.” He doesn’t pay his fair share, don’t worry about that. He doesn’t pay his fair share in taxes. He says that makes him smart. What does that do? What does that make you, Tiffany, make me, and millions of other hard working Americans, decent people who pay our taxes? Are we the suckers? Are we stupid because we go by the rules? He’s too weak to beat the pandemic. Cost him more than 200,000 American lives. That’s upended every part of our lives and hit working people particularly hard. Your businesses are closed and schools aren’t back to normal because Donald Trump hasn’t done his job. He hasn’t pulled Congress together to provide real relief for working people, moms, and dads, and business owners. The fact is Congress has passed a significant recovery bill, but he’s too busy being in a bunker, or in his golf course to call them into the White House to work out an agreement. He told FEMA to cut off funding for school PPE, masks, and protective gear, because it’s not a national emergency. His response during the deadly pandemic is to try to take your healthcare away by asking the Supreme Court to strike the Affordable Care Act in its entirety. Wipe it out. … the Affordable Care Act in its entirety, wipe it out, taking us back to a time when insurance companies could deny you coverage for preexisting conditions. Now, because of COVID, lung scarring or heart problems is a consequence of having survived COVID. That could be the next pre-existing conditions affecting millions of people. Taking away Medicare benefits for seniors. Throw your adult kids off your healthcare insurance. Think about his plan for your social security. The social security actuary said that if he follows through on his plan for social security, social security will be quote, “Bankrupt by 2023.” It clear that he not only cares about Wall Street and the super wealthy and the Fortune 500, he thinks they built this country. That’s why he wants another $30 billion tax cut for the hundred wealthiest billionaires in the country, who have already made $ 30 billion during this pandemic. So they’ll pay a lower tax rate than you do as a teacher, a factory worker, a firefighter, a nurse. He gave a tax giveaway for corporations and they moved jobs overseas to sell goods back to the United States. Here comes the train that he tried to make sure didn’t continue to run. That’s the commuter. All right. But folks, look, he let big corporation jump in front of the line to get the recovery aid that Congress had passed while small businesses are struggling to say open. In the end, his measure of economic health is the stock market. In four years as president, he’s broken his promise, he’s forgotten the forgotten Americans he said he was always going to fight for. Well, I never will forget. I know the middle class working people built this country and I measure our economic success by what families are talking about around their kitchen tables this morning. Some of them with an empty chair because they lost a family member. The ones I saw every night on my train ride from Washington to Wilmington, Delaware, as I said after my wife and daughter were killed when I was first elected, I started going home every single night so I’d be there in the morning to get my kids, Beau Hunter and Ashley ready for school. Actually, Jill, God love her, she came into our life five years later and made things good. For 36 years, I said, I took that 250 mile round trip journey each day. I’d get to know the train engineers, the conductors, the fellow passengers, and at night, I’d see the pinpoints of lights in the homes in the cities and towns along the way from Washington to Wilmington and wonder what those families are talking about after they put their kids to bed. My guess is the same thing that all Americans across the country are talking about today, asking questions as profound and as ordinary as, will we be okay? Will we be able to keep our insurance? What are we going to do? Folks, this election has a choice between Scranton and Park Avenue values, between Cleveland and Park Avenue values, between Alliance and Park Avenue values. But it’s also about something deeper. Can these parents look their kids in the eye and say, ” Honey, everything’s going to be okay.” These are the conversations I’m going to be having today in this whistle stop tour through Ohio and Pennsylvania, talking to folks about how I’ll get the virus under control, lay out the plan, bringing Congress together to provide relief and resources to schools and business so we can reopen our economy safely and strongly with a real plan and real leadership. Talking to folks about how I’d create good paying jobs, union jobs, to support working families and build our economy back. Not just back, but build it back better. I’ll protect your Medicare and social security and how I’ll fight to protect pensions, including fixing  employer pensions so that many union women and men in Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Iowa, Minnesota, Delaware, all across this country, are able to keep what they earned and deserve. I’ll fight for American jobs with the dignity of work and make the wealthy and corporations began to pay their fair share. I’ll protect your right to healthcare and build on and improve the Affordable Care Act and I’ll always tell you the truth. I’ll always care about you, whether you vote for me or not. If elected, I’m not going to be a Democratic president, I’m going to be an American president. Whether you voted for me or not, I’m going to be your president and I’ll never forget the people, the working people of this country, because that’s what I’ve come from. That, given just half a chance, the American people can do anything. Just like you, Tiffany, and your husband, you’ve stood up. You can do anything. I want to make something absolutely clear. There’s overwhelming reason for optimism. Reverend, as you said, there’s overwhelming reason. We just have to unite. The country is ready to do that. We’re better positioned than any nation in the world to own the 21st century, we just have to do it and do it together. So I leave you Rev and thank you for your invocation by saying, God bless you all and may God protect our troops. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Keep the faith. We’re coming back. Thank you. Love Johnstown. It’s good to be back. It’s good to be back. Well, thank you. I tell you what, I first came to Johnstown and it was all Democrat. And guess what? Johnstown and this county’s going to be Democrat again after this election.  It’s good to be back, man. I’ll tell you what. It’s been an incredible day. We started this morning in Cleveland, Ohio, where just last night I had a truly unique experience of debating whatever his name was, Donald Trump. Oh, man. And from there, we’ve been to communities all across Ohio and Western Pennsylvania. We’re finishing up right here in Johnstown tonight. I want to thank the lieutenant governor, for being here. We call lieutenant governor’s wife  governor. So, governor, thanks for being here and thank your wife as well and all the local elected officials and leaders for joining us today. And, Brian, thank you for your years of service and your wife’s service to our country, the United States Navy, and for sharing your stories with us. Last night, the President of the United States was reminded that he said that our veterans were losers and suckers. No, I’m serious about this. Like your family, my son spent a year in Iraq. It’s about ready. That’s a good thing. It’s still running. That’s a good thing. But wait, he came back decorated with the Bronze Star and the Conspicuous Service Medal. I thought it was despicable, that Donald Trump referred to everyone, from my friend and colleague and my competitor, John McCain, straight through to my son and others. It’s despicable. The man doesn’t deserve to be Commander in Chief of the world’s best military. But I want to thank the good people at Amtrak, who’ve been keeping me moving today. Quite frankly, my whole career. I started by taking the train, when I got elected as a 29 year old kid, to the United States Senate. I started going back and forth every single day, so I could be home in Wilmington every night with two young boys as a single dad after I lost my wife. Two hours each way, nearly 250 miles every day, so I could be there for breakfast with the boys. It wasn’t Ozzie and Harriet stuff, it was just sort of cornflakes. But at least I got to be there to play with my daughter, kiss them good morning, go home and kiss them goodnight. That train brought me back to my home base every single night, to my family. It kept me grounded. It kept me connected. It meant I always remembered what and who really mattered in my life. And riding that train all those miles every day, and I spent as the conductors informed me, over 2,100,000 miles on Amtrak. They said, “Biden, they named a station after you.” They should have named the whole damn road after me all those times. All kidding aside. But seriously, it’s a true story. I’d ride home at night after a debate with the United States Senate, about a fair tax policy, or about healthcare, or about unions that I was fighting for. And I look out… I really mean this. I look out like I did coming from Cleveland today. I look out at all those home I pass, those middle class neighborhoods like I was raised in. I was raised in, like a lot of you I expect, a three bedroom… I was raised, like a lot of you I expect, in a three-bedroom home, split level house, four kids, mom, dad and a grandpop living with us. I tell you what, I wonder if you’re having the same conversation that my mom and dad had when we were growing up, sitting there, wondering, “Honey, we need four new tires on the car. We can’t afford it. We’ve got to wait another couple months before we can get them.” Who’s going tell them, we might not have the money to help them go back to the university this semester? Who’s going to say it? Maybe we’re going to have to worry about whether or not they’re turning the electricity off because we’re behind on our bill because of job change, or I lost my health insurance. Those are conversations that people are having today. The fact of the matter is, the vast majority of people in the middle class, over 50% said if they got a bill for $400 and it was unexpected in one month, that they could either borrow money or sell something to pay it. I think about their struggles and their words. I think about their hopes and their dreams. I talked to the other passengers on the train, and I got pretty friendly with some of the conductors. I learned about their lives and their families. It was a constant reminder that every single person has their own unique story, their own journey. In my experience, everyone is just looking for a chance. It’s not a guarantee. It’s a chance to get ahead, just a fair shot, an equal opportunity to pursue their dreams. That dream gets further and further out of reach for so many folks here in Johnstown, my hometown of Scranton, Claymont where I was raised. It’s getting harder and harder. That’s what I’ve seen today at every stop on that train, from the folks who join me on this trip. I’ve spent time with a dedicated school elementary teacher from Lawrencetown, Ohio, who spoke about how the GM Plant … Remember, the President said, “Don’t sell your homes. Everything’s going to be okay in Lawrencetown. Everything’s going to stay.” That GM plant closed and guess what? It devastated the whole community. About how her own husband had to accept a transfer to a plant in Kentucky, an eighth-hour drive each way, only home on the weekends, just in order to maintain his healthcare and his pension. Now, he drives 16 hours every weekend, just to see her and the kids. I listened to an incredible young woman, a mother of four at home, a heath aide and a nursing student. Talk about how worried she is that no one is looking out for the caregivers in this country, the people who, so many of them have literally risked and given their lives so that we’d be okay, especially during this pandemic. I saw steel workers and iron workers whose union brothers and sisters built Pittsburgh’s famous bridges, proud operating engineers who keep the engines of our economy pumping. I heard from union members who’ve gotten a raw deal so many times and so many more at every stop that I made, just hard working people like all of you, folks who played by the rules and paid their fair share their whole lives, folks who never asked for a single thing to be given to them, just a chance to earn it. Folks, it couldn’t be a more stark difference from what I saw last night on that debate stage, a self-entitled, self-serving President who thinks everything is about him. He thinks that, if he just yells louder and louder, throws out lie after lie after lie, he’ll get his way. He thinks you’ll forget. Well, he picked the wrong guy. I don’t forget. I don’t forget that in February, he’s on tape acknowledging he knew how serious this pandemic was. He knew how quickly it would spread, that thousands of people would be killed, but he forgot to say a single thing. He kept it secret. He was more worried about the stock market collapsing than about the over 205,000 people who’ve died. He didn’t say a word. What did he tell us? He said it’d be gone by Easter. It will go away in the warm weather. He told us it will just go away like a miracle, and then maybe if we injected bleach in our arm, we may be okay. He thinks we’ll forget about how badly he mismanaged this pandemic that cost us more so far than 205,000 lives and counting, almost 30 million people on unemployment insurance. He thinks we’ll forget the reason our businesses and our schools are closed is because he took no responsibility. He’s a complete failure. He didn’t get the people the PPE, the resources they need to be able to reopen safely. He didn’t speak to you or the American people about the concerns. Not even once last night did he say a word about anything. Seriously, think about it. Not once, because not only the trail of broken promises, lies he told communities like Johnstown and all across the industrial Midwest, it’s more than that. Just as I said last night, when he heard that 1,000 people a day were dying, what was his comment? He said, “It is what it is.” That’s because he is who he is. Then, when he ran, he told us how much he cared about people like my family and yours, the places we come from. His staff reported him saying, this is about three weeks ago, the truth is, he said that he in fact, thinks that we’re all losers. He doesn’t respect. No, behind closed doors, it’s been reported that he called his own supporters, working class folks that the Democrats along the way began to forget about, what he called them, his supporters, quote, “Disgusting.” He’s the same guy who lets you earn a couple bucks parking cars at his country club, but even if you had the money, he wouldn’t allow you to join. They look down the nose at working families trying to do it right. It’s been confirmed by multiple sources that he thinks that those of us who signed up and put our country, put our lives on the line, our veterans, as I mentioned earlier, are just suckers and losers. I mean this from the bottom of my heart. It’s absolutely despicable. I’ll tell you. By the way, six of his generals, who work for him, all say he’s not worthy of being President of the United States of America, his own generals. I’ll tell you right now, that’s not how I was raised. It’s not how you were raised. It’s not how the vast majority of Americans who break their neck every day just wanting to get a fair shake were raised. By the way, Donald Trump can only see the world from Park Avenue. He cares only what the super rich and connected thinks. He only sees value in stock portfolios. I don’t own a single share of stock. I have the dubious distinction, when I got elected … Maybe that’s why he doesn’t like me very much. I’ve been listed as the poorest man in Congress for 36 years. You think I’m joking? I’m not proud of it. It’s true. I think you’re supposed to earn money while you’re in politics. In addition to that, when I got elected to the Vice Presidency, the headline in the paper saying it’s probable no man has ever assumed the office of the Vice President with few assets than Joe Biden. I don’t think they were speaking intellectually. Guess what? His only metric is how the economy is doing, his Dow Jones. It doesn’t matter if communities like Johnstown are still hurting, and he doesn’t have a plan to help you or get back on your feet or deliver relief to the people who most need help. He’s too busy planning for his next big tax giveaway. It’s a true story. Billionaires made $300 billion more in this pandemic, fact, and now you know what his new tax plan is? He’s proposing another $30 billion tax cut for billionaires by reducing what they call capital gains to 15%. They’ll be making billions and paying a lower rate than a firefighter, a school teacher, a school teacher and a firefighter together, a lower rate. The 100 richest folks in this country, are in fact, own more wealth than about half the population. It’s time, when nearly 30 million people are on unemployment, 100 million people, he’s trying to take away your healthcare. 100 million people with pre-existing conditions, he’s going to court a week after the election to try to eliminate the Affordable Care Act. By the way, if this, if I tried, if we made a movie about this, they’d think it’s just all fiction. It couldn’t be possible. In the middle of this pandemic, when you have seven million people infected, 40,000- … million people infected. 40,000 a day becoming infected. 750 to 1000 a day dying. And his one goal is to take away healthcare. Not a joke, not a joke. 10 million people have already lost the healthcare provided by their employers because their employers have gone out of business. 10 million, and 20 million people, if he gets his way, and I think it’s on November 7th, 8th, 9th, or 10th, I go to the Supreme Court. They’ll lose, 20 million people will lose their health insurance. More than a hundred million people with pre-existing conditions will in fact be charged more for their coverage. What’s going to happen is, in addition to that, when they eliminate the Affordable Care Act, we’re going to be able to charge women more money running from the same procedures men getting charged for. Not a joke. And that’s what the law he wants to eliminate will do. Pregnancy will become again, not a joke, a pre-existing condition that you can charge a great deal more for. Folks, we can’t let that happen. He’s too busy trying to salvage his foundering re-election campaign to understand that people don’t want a superficial temporary tax cut on their withholding tax because  take it out of social security. You know what the social security actuary said? “If this plane goes through, social security will be totally bankrupt by 2023.” I know this sounds ridiculous. Remember I told you, Paul Ryan was there. They wanted to cut Medicaid and cut social security. That was in their budget. That’s what they want to do. I don’t know where these guys come from. Look, I’ve dealt with guys like Trump my whole life, guys who look down on us because they got them out of money, inherited it, guys who think they’re better than you, guys, who, as I said, might let you park the car at a country club they own but never let you join or come in, guys who inherited everything you’ve ever gotten and then squandered it. I see the world from where I grew up in Scranton. Not a joke. You see it from a different perspective of Johnstown or any time we stopped in today. It’s filled with people who are busting their necks to do right by their families every day. They aren’t worried about the stock market. They’re worried about putting food on the table every night. They’re worried about making the rent. 20 million people are worried they won’t be able to pay their mortgage payment this month. 20 million. My mom used to always say, Jean Finnegan Biden from Scranton, she said, “Joey, remember, look at me, Joey, nobody is better than you, but everyone is your equal.” He doesn’t get that. When my dad had to leave Scranton when there were no jobs and we moved to Wilmington, he didn’t have to commute like the woman I met today, her husband, eight hours each way, but he had to commute back and forth to Wilmington every weekend and that was only a three and a half hour drive each way. But when we got to Delaware and finally were able to buy a house three years later, my dad used to day, “Joe, the job’s about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about your dignity. It’s about respect. It’s about your place in the community.” That’s what was missing today. Providing dignity to the work do we. Those are the values that shaped my life, and when it gets down to it, I think this whole campaign gets down to Park Avenue versus Scranton. Park Avenue versus Johnstown. Trump may think there ought to be a different set of rules for him and his rich buddies, rules that get them out of taxes, get them out of responsibilities, get them out of consequences for every one of the mistakes they make. But I don’t think so. I think it’s about time to start rewarding work and not wealth. And I think it’s about time that families get a break and the super wealthy and corporate America start paying their fair share. We’re still going to do well, even if they pay their fair share. But here’s what I know. Donald Trump will never understand. Wall Street didn’t build this country, CEOs didn’t. The middle class built America and unions built the middle class. That’s why my plan is about helping communities like Johnstown and Scranton and Claymont, places I grew up, to build that better. I’m here today to say to you, I’ll do as President what Donald Trump hasn’t. I’ll fight for you. Not for the corporations. You, your jobs, your family. Now we’re going to build back better. It’s all about injecting life and capital back into places like Johnstown. It starts with a simple proposition. Buy American. The federal government spends $600 billion of your taxpayer’s money every single year on everything from military equipment to steel railings to buildings to highways, cars and trucks in federal fleets. While I’m President, we’re going to make sure that every one of those products, every single piece that goes into any of those contracts is made and built in America. I’m serious. We can do this.  send jobs overseas. Any company in my administration that off shores jobs will pay a 10% penalty, and any company that brings jobs back or reopens the closed factories like those around Johnstown will get a 10% credit and an incentive to build back. We’re going to direct billions of dollars in revitalization funds and competitive grants to help places like Johnstown compete for new businesses and startups. We’re going to make four years of public education, two years of community college free for families making less than under 25 grand. We’re going to lower healthcare costs by increasing subsidies for your premiums so they’re lower, slashing the cost of prescription drugs by literally as much as 60%. And you say, “How do you do that, Joe?” Well, we’re going to do a system that sets up an expert panel of 25 people for every new drug that comes on the market. You have to go before that group of experts, they’ll set the price based on your investment, just like you do for your utility, and you cannot raise that price ever again beyond the cost of medical inflation. We’re going to take on the opioid crisis  effective treatment, and for substance use disorders. We’re going to do it all without raising a penny in taxes for anybody who makes less than $400,000 a year. If you make more than $400,000, I’m going to raise your taxes. So raise your hand. No, maybe you didn’t believe me that I could do that without raising taxes on the middle class. But hat’s before you found out that the billionaire Donald Trump only paid $750 in income taxes. If Trump’s Park Avenue pals start paying their fair share we’ll have more than enough money to finally build an economy that works for everybody. So I promise you this. I see you. I hear you. I respect you. I grew up with you. And the families of those more than 200,000 Americans that have died in this pandemic will be heard and respected by me. I’ll work like crazy to get this pandemic under control so we can get our economy working again, for everyone to get back our lives. We’re a nation in incredible pain right now. So many empty chairs around the dining table at night because somebody’s been lost to the family. So many businesses closed, doors closed forever because the money that the Congress voted to get to small businesses went to his friends, his rich friends on Wall Street. So many proud people on unemployment for the first time in their lives, not able to get the kind of unemployment insurance that we initially passed in Congress. As my wife said, “This is not a partisan moment. This is an American moment.” No, I really mean it. We can’t afford to go on being divided. We can’t afford to have a leader who does nothing but throw gasoline on the anger and hatred that’s burning in this country. We have to come together. Look, I promise you all this. I’m running as a proud Democrat, but I will be an American President.  for those who support me as those who did not, I promise you this, I’ll fight for you. That’s what we need right now, a President who will try to bring us together, who will speak to what is best in all of us, rather than trying to divide us. Put that dog whistle out, and racism. Did you hear that he said last night? When he was asked by the Fox commentator, asked would he condemn White supremacy, which the FBI says is a serious threat to terrorism in America today, he said, “Well, of course, I’m against all bad news.” I said, “How about the Proud Boys?” “The Proud Boys,” he said, “Well, I’ll tell you what. Just tell them to stand down but stand by.” Go online. The Proud Boys now have a logo saying, “Stand down but stand by.” And they said in the newspaper today that  was Vladimir Putin. Not a joke. In fact, threaten that if he doesn’t win, there’ll be violence. Look, we’ve got to stop pitting ourselves against one another. We’re one people. We’re one nation, one America. We need to remember who in God’s name we are. This is the United States of America. In our long history, there’s been nothing, nothing ever, think about this. In every crisis we’ve ever had, there’s not going to single thing we’ve been unable to overcome, nothing, when we act together, and we’ve done it together. … when we act together, we’ve done it together. Folks, I am so optimistic about what the country is ready to do. No, no, I really am. I think we’re ready to stand up, I think the blinders have been taken off the American people. They understand what’s at stake. We can own the 21st century. We are, as Madeleine Albright said, ” The essential country.” We can and must lead the world again. We’ve not only led the world by the example of our power, but the power of our example. Why does the rest of the whole follower us? Because of who we are, what we stand for, our example, and it’s being trashed all over the world. There was a recent Pew poll done in the major nations of the world, Donald Trump as president, this is not a joke. Check it online. Donald Trump is less respected than President Xi and Putin. Can you imagine that? So folks, look, as I said, this United States of America, we can do anything, and we’re about to do it. With your help, the grace of God and the goodwill of our neighbors, as my grandpa would say, “We’re coming back.” So God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. We are coming back this year. 30 something days. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Thank you, thank you. Hey folks. Good afternoon. Before I start, let me explain the delay. We wanted to make sure that we’re doing everything by the numbers. And so I got two COVID tests this morning, one in Delaware, and one by the former White House doc who came up and everything’s cleared. We want to make sure everything was clear before I came. We were supposed to have an event after this at a headquarters, but based on the crowd size and an indoor, it was concluded by the docs that best not to do it. But I want to thank all of you. I want to thank Matt. And Matt, you’re dead right. You were putting yourself on the line and a lot of other people did all across this country in your union. And I want to thank David way, Secretary-Treasurer of local 951, for having me here today. Look, I’d like to start by acknowledging which I sure all of you do as well. Sending my prayers for the health and safety of the first lady and president of the United States after they tested positive for COVID-19. My wife, Jill and I pray that they’ll make a quick and full recovery. This is not a matter of politics. It’s a bracing reminder to all of us that we have to take this virus seriously. It’s not going away automatically. We have to do our part to be responsible. It means following the science, listening to the experts, washing our hands, social distancing. It means wearing a mask in public and means encouraging others to do so as well. It means having masking mandates nationwide. The director of the CDC, Center for Disease Control, Dr. Red field said, and I quote, and he held up a mask. He said, “These face masks are the most important, powerful public health tool we have.” Then he held the mask up again and said, “This face mask is more guaranteed to protect me against COVID than a vaccine.” Leading scientist from the University of Washington tell us that we can save more than 100,000 American lives in the next 100 days alone if everyone wore a mask in public. So let me repeat that because it’s so important. We can save 100,000 lives in the next 100 days, according to the head of the CDC, if everyone wears a mask in public. So be patriotic. It’s not about being a tough guy. It’s about doing your part. Wearing a mask is not only going to protect you, but it also protects those around you. Your mom, your dad, your brother, your sister, husband, wife, neighbor, coworker. Don’t just do it for yourself, do it for the people you love, the people you work with. The seriousness of this virus also underscores that we need regular testing with results turned around rapidly and that’s available to everyone. It’s not just the folks in the White House or who travel with me that deserved regular testing, it’s folks in the meatpacking and food processing plants, grocery store workers. Every single American deserves safety and peace of mind. And it means we need transparency. Those who test positive need to participate in contact tracing so that everyone who they may have exposed can get tested themselves. That’s how you stop transmission for any epidemic. Is basic. We need to take the science of fighting this disease seriously if we’re going to save lives. And above all the news is a reminder that we, as a nation, need to do better in dealing with this pandemic. Taking these steps is how we’ll protect ourselves. And just as important is how we will protect one another. Hope that all those who are fighting this virus, including the first family and so many Americans today recover and recover soon. My prayers are with the families of the more than 200. I think it’s seven now. 207,000 Americans who’ve died from this virus. Many haven’t got up this morning. The breakfast table with an the empty chair of someone they lost and they loved. We understand. And there’s more than 7 million Americans who are have been infected. That includes folks here in Grand Rapids and all across Michigan, especially all of you or that you have with UFCW who are on the front lines of this pandemic and on the front lines of this economic crisis. UFCW workers who have always been on the front lines of fighting for dignity and respect you deserve. I know it’s been tough. This morning, September jobs report came out. The last one before election day. I’m grateful for all those who were able to get their jobs back to work again, but it was fewer jobs than we had hoped for. Millions of families, millions are still wondering when it will be their turn to come back from the brink. And the signs according to national press are not encouraging. Once again, the pace of job gains is slowing down. Once again, we’re seeing temporary layoffs turn permanent. This month marked the largest single month increase in long-term unemployment since we started keeping records in 1948. There are now an additional 781,000 Americans who have been trying to find work for at least six months. They’ve been looking for work for at least six months and haven’t found it. And in the past, that’s a sign for permanency for them. We’re still down 647,000 manufacturing jobs nationwide since the crisis started. All told, we are now 30 million workers who have either lost hours, lost paychecks or lost their jobs entirely. Participating in labor force participation fell last month and remains sharply down since this crisis began, especially for women. There’s another roughly 700,000 people who have dropped out of the labor force. Stopped looking for a job. The vast majority were women demonstrating once again how this economic crisis has been especially tough on women and families in This country. This will be the first presidency in modern history to leave office with fewer jobs than when it came into office. Michigan has lost more than then 361,000 jobs since the beginning of 2017. In fact, factories were already closing before COVID like the Knoll plant here in Grand Rapids. They announced back in January, they were shutting down and cutting 210 local jobs. Manufacturing has already slipped into recession last year. The net loss of auto manufacturing jobs you saw here in Michigan. And that economic pain was only amplified by the pandemic. Your schools and local businesses are closed like all places around America. More than 26 million unemployment claims were filed by Americans last month. 46 million Americans have exhausted their emergency savings and essential workers here in Grand Rapids won’t forget how the UFCW members saw their jobs turned suddenly into a life and death task. Folks, today’s report reinforces another painful trend. A continuing of what economists call a K-shaped recovery. And K means that letter going up. That’s those who on the top, it keeps going up while everyone else in the middle is going down and below. We’re seeing things get worse. It means essential workers, UFCW workers who sacrificed to keep us going through the pandemic and continuing are being left behind by the most unequal recovery in modern history. Because while workers are struggling, this is a fact, the top 100 billionaires in America have done pretty well. Just the top 100 of them. They’ve made up more than $30 billion this year in the last nine months. And everyone else, though you keep hoping, you get the bottom of that K-shaped recovery. You get the downward slide. You’re left to figure out how you’re going to pay the bills and put food on the table. How to balance doing your job with being a teacher to your kids because their school has gotten remote. You’re asked to risk your neck because you can’t work from home when the risks for COVID are kept outside because you work at a meat packing plant or an assembly line or the checkout counter. I do understand this is a scary time, an uncertain time. I understand it and I see you because I see the world from where I grew up in Scranton, Pennsylvania. A lot like Grand Rapids. It’s filled with an awful lot of good people busting their neck every day, do the right thing for their families. In Scranton my mom used to have an expression. She said not just in Scranton, but from the time we left there. She said, “Joey, nobody’s better than you Joey, but everybody’s your equal.” My dad’s constant refrain after he lost a job in Scranton when there were no more work and he had to move to Delaware. He moved away for a little over a year and come back every weekend to see us. The time we finally, a couple years down the road in Delaware, got to finally be able to buy a home. My dad used to use this expression. He said, “Joey, a job’s about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about your dignity. It’s about respect. It’s about your place in the community.” These are the values that shaped my growing up and I suspect most you. It shaped my whole life. So I know and understood from the very beginning of consciousness about this, that Wall Street and CEOs didn’t build this country, the middle-class built this country and unions built the middle class. That’s why I’ve laid out a comprehensive agenda, not just to rebuild our communities, but to make bold investments so we can build back and bill back better. And independent analysis actually from Wall Street, Moody’s, projected that my plan will create 18.6 million jobs. 7 million more than the administration’s economic plan and $1 trillion more in economics growth than the president’s plan. That’s not coming from a liberal think tank, that’s coming from Moody’s. Here’s how my plan works. I’m going to raise taxes on people only making over 400. Anyone making less than $400,000 a year won’t pay a penny more. But I’m going to ask the very big corporations, the Fortune 500 and the wealthy to pay their fair share for a change. That means raising the corporate tax rate, which was in the mid 30s and now is 21% back to 28%. That means making sure that no big company gets away with paying zero taxes as 91 Fortune 500 companies do today making billions of dollars. Zero taxes. How many of you pay zero taxes? Means making sure the wealthiest Americans don’t get to pay at a lower tax rate because they’re making money on their investments, but they pay at the same rate that they pay for their salary. These changes in the tax code will raise the money, it’ll allow me to invest in working people and growing the middle class. Which is when I announced I was running, I said, that’s the reason. To rebuild the backbone of this country. Hardworking folks in the middle class, we’re going to invest in creating millions of good paying jobs, union jobs. By the way, my plan has been thoroughly analyzed by a whole bunch of folks. Take infrastructure, building roads, bridges, highways, ports, airports will put millions of people to work in good paying union jobs and create the foundation for growth in this country. Clean energy. Just upgrading 4 million buildings and weatherizing 2 million homes will create at least 1 million good paying jobs. Leading in the world on electric vehicles and building 500,000 electric charging stations on our highways will create 1 million new auto jobs here in this state. The manufacturing and technology in those areas, making sure the future is made in America, made in Michigan with good union jobs. The federal government spends $600 billion a year of your tax dollars. 600 billion a year to purchase everything from military equipment to steel, to cars, to trucks, to federal fleets at $600 billion. When I’m president, we’re going to make sure we finally make good on a commitment made a long time ago that these products, all these contracts, that the president of United States and the federal government can award, make sure those products are made by Americans in America. Making sure that, that’s done. It’s estimated that we’ll create 5 million new manufacturing jobs and technology jobs. For small businesses, we’re going to make sure small businesses come out on the other side of this terrible circumstance with access to capital and the ability to deal with the debts that have been accumulated during this pandemic. And we’ll make investments to increase incomes as well. $15 minimum wage. No one should be in a position to have to work two jobs just to get above the poverty line. We’re going to bring back jobs from overseas to America and direct billions of dollars in revitalization funds and competitive grants to help communities like those in Western Michigan compete for new business startups. For our essential workers, we’re not just going to praise you, we’re going to pay you a good wage to ensure you have a strong benefits. We’re going to ease the burden of the major cost in your life. Healthcare. We’ll build on the Affordable Care Act through a new health insurance option, a not-for-profit public option which will give private insurers a real competitor. We’ll increase subsidies for your premiums so they’re lower. So you can afford the plans with lower deductions and lower out-of-pocket expenses. That plan alone will cost over $700 billion over 10 years, but it’s paid for by eliminating those tax cuts. For a 40 year old making $50,000 a year, your monthly premium will go down by a third. We’ll take on the pharmaceutical companies with a plan that slashes the cost of prescription drugs for up to 60%. Medicare will be able to negotiate prices for drugs fundamentally lowering those prices. And childcare. A lot of you’re dealing with that now. How do you go to work if you have work and take care of your kids or an aging relative that’s in trouble? We’re going to make high quality childcare affordable and accessible. Every three and four year old will have access to free quality preschool. We’re going to make sure that low and middle-income families will never have to pay more than 7% of their income for caring for a young child. In education beyond high school. We’re going to make sure that four year college tuition of a state university is tuition free for any family making less than $125,000. Community college would be free and programs and training will be free as well. If you buying your first home, you’ll have a $15,000 help to get there. These are all things that people have been talking about for a while. We’re going to protect social security, increase the benefits for millions of seniors. The president’s talking about eliminating the withholding tax. Well, that’s wonderful except for one thing, the actuary of social security said if that plan goes through social security will be bankrupt by 2023. Folks, I promise you, we can do this. Let me close by saying this. I know a lot of people around here are tired of feeling overlooked and disrespected. I get that. The people I met this week taking a train through Northeastern, Ohio and Western Pennsylvania. People like the dedicated elementary school teacher from Lordstown, Ohio, whose husband, when Lordstown shut down accepted a transfer to Kentucky eight hours away each direction in order to be able to keep his healthcare and his pension after the GM plant closed. Folks who worry about healthcare. Will the Affordable Care Act still be there for them? Why? Why they ask. Will I be among the 100 million Americans who could lose the protections for pre-existing conditions like asthma and diabetes? Where once again, women will be able to charge a higher premium just simply because they’re a woman. Where insurers no longer have to allow you to be able to keep your kids on a healthcare plan until age 26. What will happen to your Medicare benefits, your social security? Will they still be there when you retire? I’m asked many times in recent years, how do we get to the place where people who stock our shelves, pack our food, teach our kids like my family, take care of my wife, take care of our sick, who race into burning buildings and pick up the garbage off our streets. Who did. How do we get to the place where you all don’t think we see you anymore or hear them and most importantly, respect them? That has to change. I know it can. I come from those neighborhoods. We can get this pandemic under control so we can get our economy working again for everyone. But this cannot be a partisan moment, it must be an American moment. We have to come together as a nation. I’m running as a Democrat, but I will run and govern as an American president. Whether you voted for me or against me, I will represent you. And those who see each other as fellow Americans who just don’t live in red states or blue states, but who live in and love the United States of America. That’s who we are. And there’s never been a single solitary thing America’s been unable to do. Think of this. Not once. Not a single thing we’ve not been able to overcome when we’ve done it together. So let’s get the heck up. Remember who in God’s name we are. This is the United States of America. There’s nothing beyond our capacity. I want to say, God bless you and God protect the first family and every family who’s dealing with this virus and may God protect our troops. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Well, John, you are my friend, Mr. President. I want to say good afternoon to everyone, and it’s great to see you all. I’m here today above all else to say thank you. Thank you, President Costa and the entire executive board for the chance to speak with you all today. And thank you for being one of the first juniors to endorse me last year. You stepped up for me and I won’t forget it. And I thank you for the bravery and commitment you show to your jobs and to the people you serve every single day. A lot of people don’t get it. You’re in the front lines of this pandemic. And as we’ve all seen too clearly this week, COVID-19 is still a threat to our health, as well as our economic security. We have to do so much more to step up to get this virus under control. We need to take science, the science of fighting this disease seriously if we’re going to save lives. That means making sure essential workers, and you all are that and more, folks like you get to, and the people who are doing all of the work on the buses, subway system, keeping the country moving every single day, you have to make sure you get all the PPE you need. You need it for job safety, and for our safety, to be able to continue to transport people. We need a nation-wide mask guidance so that no one gets on a public transportation unit without a mask. When they turned that request down, the Department of Transportation, they made a gigantic mistake. It’s everyone’s pay … It’s not something that has taken away someone’s freedom. It’s a patriotic duty to wear a mask. You do it not just to protect yourself, but to protect one another. It’s essential. You should be worried about the person next to you, in front of you, your husband, wife, mother, father, friend, neighbor. It’s essential. And it can save, as the experts have told us, up to a hundred thousand lives just between now and the end of the year, where it’s estimated by the University of Washington, as many as 200,000 more people will die from COVID unless we do something. 89 ATO members, as you’ve already … We just had a moment of silence, lost their lives to this virus. It’s heartbreaking. Think of the families that get up this morning and there’s an empty chair at the table. It’s unacceptable. We all know. I know what it’s like to have that kind of loss. It’s unacceptable. Even before this pandemic, we knew that your jobs were dangerous. You face harassments and threats of violence and so much more. So, we need to put in place the protections and precautions to keep you safe in your work. You’re there every single day for the people who depend on you. You deserve leadership in government who will be there for you, will fight for you, prioritize your health, your safety, and in the process, prioritizing everybody’s health and safety. You’re the ones who fight for the right to organize and bargain collective. And I promise you, the National Labor Relations Act way back in the ’30s, everybody thinks that said, okay, now we can have unions. If you go back and read it, it said we should encourage unions, encourage unions. That’s what it was intended to do. My dad used to have an expression. He said the only way to fight the abuse of power is with power. Power. And the only power we have to fight back is unions, unions who understand that Wall Street didn’t build this country. Middle class built this country, and unions built the middle class. That’s not hyperbole. That’s a fact. And I’ll be a president who sees you, respects you, and that’s my promise to you. I’ve been running on support for public transit my entire career. Our transportation workers were with me since my first Senate campaign back a hundred years ago in 1972 when I was a 29 year old kid, and I won by 3,200 votes in no small part because you guys came out for me. Enhancing and upgrading our public transportation structures is an essential part of my build back better plan to get us out of this recession. But I also know that people need help right now. You need help right now. With so many fewer people riding public transit right now, we need to make sure that state and local governments have the funding they need to keep you running. Thanks to your leadership, the Cares Act secured $25 billion in emergency operating aid for transit. But I think we need to do more. We need to do more than just thank you. We need to pay you. Excuse me. This pandemic has taken the blinders off so many Americans. It’s shown us so clearly just how much we depend on you and all essential workers and how much we owe you. I’m not just saying that. That’s a fact. So, I’m going to say thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for all you do for this country. And I know there’s so much more to say, but I know you have questions for me, John. And I’d just like to say again, thank you, and I’m happy to take a few questions. Fundamentally differently. And I’m in a little bit of a spot here because I don’t want to be attacking the President and the First Lady now because they now have contracted Coronavirus, and Jill and I pray for their quick and full recovery, but our thoughts are with the families and the members you’ve lost as well. We have to bear the grief of an empty chair, an empty kitchen table chair, of not being able to turn and … I find myself when I lost folks in my family, you just tend to go. And you realize, no, it’s never coming back. This isn’t about politics. More than 200,000 Americans have died from COVID. 7.3 million have been infected. 30 million have lost paychecks, hours, or their jobs entirely. And throughout it all, you’ve kept the nation running. You’ve kept people connected. You put others before yourselves, and whether they understand it or not, and I think average Americans do now, we can’t thank you enough. It’s always been essential, even if the rest of the country is just learning what an essential worker really is. Now look, here’s what else is essential. Getting you the support you need to do your job. It’s not enough just to praise you. We have to protect and pay you. We have to work as hard as you, as hard work as you do for your communities. And here’s what I’ll do as President. Number one, call on every single American to wear a mask when they’re around other people outside their households. That includes when they ride public transportation, buses, trains airplanes. Yesterday, the transportation department, stupidly in my view, rejected a petition to require just that, wear a mask when you’re on public transportation. If I can say something here, this is not about freedom. It’s about patriotism. You wear a mask to protect the person next to you. You wear a mask to protect the bus driver. You wear a mask to protect the person you’re sitting next to on the bus. And to reject the chance to do the easiest thing possible to save lives, I find it appalling. I promise you my Department of Transportation will insist on it. Two, get protective gear to every worker on the front lines. It’s unconscionable that for so long Washington left our states, cities, and transit agencies to bid against one another. If that’s not the President’s responsibility, what the heck is his responsibility? Not my fault. I have no responsibility. Go to your mayor, your governor, your employer. It’s unconscionable that seven months in so many transit employees still aren’t provided enough PPE to keep you safe on the job. By the way paranthetically, it’s not just you guys he doesn’t care about. They don’t care about much of anybody. They started off promising they were going to give school teachers and school children masks to go back to school. Then, famous said, “No, it’s not an essential requirement.” Not essential. As President I’d use the full power of the Defense Production Act to get PPE out to every single transit worker, hospital, job site, and school in this country, and I’d appoint a supply commander to make sure it’s distributed fast and fairly. It’s within our power to do this, John. We can do this. And the idea that they’re kicking it off to the, “No, talk to your governor, not my responsibility,” come on. I don’t know. If that’s not a responsibility of a President in the middle of a crisis, I don’t know what in God’s name a responsibility is. Thirdly, we’ve got to fix the testing fiasco. Surging tens of millions of test kits where they’re needed most provide free testing and treatment and vaccine when it’s available for everyone, and make sure politics plays no role in vaccine approval. Period. I’ve actually told some governors, John, I probably shouldn’t say this, but you know me, told some governors, “Don’t endorse me. Don’t endorse me because you’ll pay a penalty. You won’t get what you need from the federal government in terms of his covert crap.” Not a joke. My word. Not a joke. We aren’t blue states and red states. We’re the United States. United States. If you elect me President, I’m going to be President for all Americans. I’m running as a Democrat proudly, but I’m going to make sure I’m President for the people who voted against me as much as those who voted for me. This division of our country is just devastating. Thirdly, or fourthly, I’m going to enforce tougher safety standards and get schools and businesses clean safety guidelines and resources, implement them. Tell people to stay healthy when they ride with you. And I’m going to fight to get you the hazard pay you deserve. And by the way, it’s not just about getting you masks. We also have to protect you. Look at the people. Look what’s happened to your drivers. A guy getting off a bus and says goodbye, and he slits the driver’s throat and kills him. Look what’s happening. We got to get you the protective gear. Not only that, we’ve got to get you separation. We’ve got to get plastic and coverings around the drivers. You’ve got to make sure that you have separation. There’s so much we can do. And it doesn’t cost that much. It doesn’t cost that much. But even if it did, it’s an obligation we have. I really mean it. I find this one of the most despicable things that I’ve encountered in my whole career. When the administration was told that there’s a thousand people a day dying of COVID, the response was, “It is what it is.” It is what it is? It is what it is because they are who they are. That’s why it is what it is. We can change this. I promise you on day one, I will. That’s right. Yep. Well first of all, we have to come together to beat the virus. Every path forward starts there. That’s how we get people back on the train, back on the buses, back on the school buses, back to go. They’re getting their lives back. And it’s how we keep our transit system solid. But along the way, one of the most urgent things we have to do is get emergency fundings out to states, cities, and transit authorities now. Now. Because of the ATU working with the House, you were able to work hard to see the 25 billion in aid that was included in the so-called Cares Act, those first pieces of relief legislation. But I know it’s not enough. Tens of thousands of transit workers have already been laid off. Tens of thousands. And I said for months, the Republican Senate needs to step up and pass another economic relief package right away so painful cuts don’t make this crisis worse. You may remember, John, when we went through this with the single-most significant recession in American history short of a depression, when Barack and I came into office and we were inherited the Bush recession. I was asked to manage the Recovery Act, which was $80 billion. Excuse me, $800 billion. And the first thing I was able to do is get over $140 billion to the states and localities so they didn’t have to lay off transit workers. They didn’t have to lay off school teachers. Didn’t have to lay off firefighters. They didn’t have to lay off police officers, because all the cities and counties have to work on balanced budgets. That’s why the founders said we didn’t have to balance budgets nationally to be able to compensate when things got bad. Well, House passed the package twice. It’s time for Mitch McConnell to do his job and save millions more hardworking Americans that don’t lose theirs. By the way, we said, “The states are going to go bankrupt.” He said, “Let them go bankrupt.” Well, we need better protection to keep you safe as well during this COVID crisis, as we discussed, but go far beyond. I’m never going to forget the bravery of Thomas Dunn, who was so viciously attacked while driving his route in Tampa last year. But somehow, still steered his passengers safely to roadside before he died. He warned about driver’s safety months before, but was left unprotected. As President, I promise you I’ll fight to get past the Transit Worker and Pedestrian Protection Act to get barriers installed to stop that kind of assault, to reduce blind spots, to make so many other things possible for you. It’s ridiculous. Like I said, I just had my license to drive a school bus when I was in law school. I can tell you what. It was hard just working out what the kids were doing behind me. I can’t fathom today. I can’t fathom today driving a bus or running a subway without having more protection. I promise you I’ll invest a record amount in infrastructure, dramatically increasing the funding for public transit to help power our recovery. That includes improving transit bus lines, helping cities and towns and small new light rail networks, investing funds in low-income communities. Somewhere between 60 and 70% of the American people who live in inner cities, their jobs are outside the city and they don’t have vehicles. They need transportation to get to their work, to improve their neighborhoods, to improve their schools. Look, this is a crisis, and we have a real opportunity to build back better. And you all, your dedication is going to get us there. But here’s the thing. Can I go on another minute, John, because I think this is pretty important? Look. What people don’t get, you guys get it, is if we invest significantly in transit, I want to invest about three quarters of a trillion dollars in transit overall, because it does two things. One, it gets people off the highways. And if you know if you have long distance transit, if you can get there as fast in a train or on a rail as you can in a vehicle, people leave their cars and get in the rail. That will save billions of gallons of oil over time and deal with pollution. Light rail in cities. I’m going to say something. One of your executive vice-presidents from Detroit, one of the things I was able to do in addition to getting our 200 buses in Detroit, we put in a light rail system. Why? Because an awful lot of those people there worked in the hospitals outside of town. And then in town, they could get back and forth to work. It saved the city, and has significantly increased the capacity to do more in the city and outside the city. We’re in a position that if we invest in rail, light rail, if we invest in buses, and we’re going to change the way buses run, we’re going to have buses that run. We’re going to get electric buses down the road. We’re going to own the electric market in vehicles, both in buses as well as automobiles, creating well over a million new jobs. Not a joke. And by the way, the Wall Street guys looked at my numbers and what I was talking about and acknowledged my plan will create seven million more jobs than the President’s, and increase by $1 trillion economic growth, because we have to start using our brain. We can both deal with climate, employment, and health if we in fact move in a direction to focus heavily on transit. If I can give you one little example, and I know the folks who are … That’s a slightly different operation, but Amtrak. In order to build, if we eliminated Amtrak on the Northeast Carter, we’d have to build eight new lanes of I-95 from Washington to New York. One mile of I-95, the cement and all that’s needed, is $20 million. $20 million. Imagine what would happen if we didn’t have rail, and imagine what would happen if we had high-speed rail. Imagine what would happen if all these towns and cities had light rail that could get people to and from work. It would save them money, save them opportunities, provide more opportunities for them. I know I’m going on too long, but this transportation is such an incredible part of our economic recovery. And by the way, we’ve got to make sure you start to get paid what you deserve. Paid what you deserve. But first and foremost, I promise you I’m going to get you all the PPE that’s necessary. That’s a promise. Secondly, we’re going to make sure you are safe on your transportation system where you are operating it. And that means plexiglass. That means mirrors. That means a whole range of things we can change in order to deal with this. And because I tell you what, you’re the guys and women I grew up with. You’re the people who make it run. Like I said, I’ll end where I began. I view things from Scranton, not from Wall Street. I view things from the folks I was raised with. A trolley line ran by my house. It was a great equalizer for everybody. We’re in a situation where we can change things drastically for the better and help everyone across the board. The wealthy will do just fine when we do better. Everybody does fine. Everybody does fine. But most important, your personal safety is critical. And I really mean it. I give you my word. So thank you, John. Thank you for your help. And thank all of you. In case you see me looking to my left here, that’s where all of you are up on the screen. There’s about 500 of you on a screen up here. So hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. And I’m looking at … Where was a beautiful little baby being held by a dad a moment ago? Anyway, that’s awful punishment to make a kid have to watch me on television here on a Zoom, but thank you very much. Appreciate it. We can do so much, John. We are in position. If we win this thing, we’re in a position to change the country. I really mean it. I really mean it. There’s gigantic hope out there. I’m confident. There’s so much we can do. And transportation is such a critical part of it all. The overall infrastructure, the overall economic recovery, making sure people … Anyway, I am going on too much, but I love you guys. Thank you. We can do this, folks. I promise you. Putting on my mask. Good afternoon, everyone. It’s great to be back in Miami. And thank you, Esther. I told you our family has been, unfortunately, this considerable consumer of healthcare. Please all sit down. Of healthcare and I’ve learned from personal experience as my sons, my daughter, my wife, family has learned if there are any angels in heaven, they’re all nurses, male and female. Docs let you live and nurses make you want to live. I really mean it. They’re there at the tough times. And by the way, thank you for your service in the military, but also thank you for the beginning of this pandemic. Being a surgical nurse wasn’t easy when there wasn’t the PPE available to all of you as you walked into those operating rooms and dealt with all the problems. I know my son-in-law’s a physician surgeon in Philadelphia and the stories at the beginning of this process, when we should have had everything available. So thank you not only for your skill and your courage, but your bravery and doing what you’ve done. And I want to thank you for the care dedication that you went on, all your fellow SEIU members, all your nurses that show up and struggle with illness or coping with the loss of a loved one in terrible times. So many of you had to hold a phone to a patient’s ear to say goodbye to a family member because they couldn’t be there. They couldn’t see them in the hospital as they passed. Now, I want to thank Victoria, Victoria for sharing her family’s journey with us today. Victoria and I were talking a little bit earlier. I was in South Asia speaking with a president and he asked me what made America unique? And I said immigration because it’s the history of this country. And he looked at me funny. He said, why is that? And I said, because almost everybody who’s come here, other than those who came in chains 400 years ago came because they’re escaping something and it took enormous courage. I really mean this. Think about it, enormous courage to leave everything they knew, everything that was familiar, sometimes leaving family members to get on a boat, a plane, train, whatever the means was to be able to leave and start a new life. And to do that, you have to have optimism, courage. You have to be resilient. You have to be willing to believe you can make things change for the better. That’s what’s built this country, immigration. We are, not figuratively, it’s a phrase used to not often fully appreciated, a nation of immigrants. That’s why we’re the most unique and strongest nation in the world. It’s family like yours and Esther’s that have made this country what it is through the hard work and faith and perseverance. The richness and beauty of Miami is built from the connections of family, culture, values that we share with our friends throughout the Caribbean and Latin America. Earlier this afternoon, I visited Little Haiti. Had been some years since been there when the earthquake occurred and I came to deliver some assistance to the Haitian community, as well as making sure we had temporary protective status granted. It’s a cultural complex and now here at the site name for one of Cuba’s most celebrated poets and thinkers. This city is living proof of the incredible strength that we draw from families and communities from every culture choosing America. So thank you, Victoria, for choosing us and I’m really honored that you’re going to vote for me in your first election. I promise you I will not let you down. I promise you I will not let you down. And let me also say at the top, my prayers continue to be with the president and the first lady for their health and safety as they like so many American families are dealing with COVID-19. I was glad to see the president speaking and recording videos over the weekend. Now that he’s busy tweeting campaign messages, I would ask him to do this, listen to the scientists, support masks, support a mask mandate nationwide, require a mask in every federal building and facility and interstate travel, urge every governor, mayor to do the same. We know it saves lives. His administration just rejected a mask mandate for public transportation on Friday. The CIA came along and said, we need to be protected and they said, no. I believe that was wrong and not very rational experts say that universal masking could say between now and January 100,000 lives. Let me say that again. Between now and January, mandatory masking could save 100,000 lives. I backed that mandate months ago. He should back it now. Since the president entered the hospital on Friday, since Friday, more than 100,000 more people have been diagnosed with COVID. And this week, at least 5,000 more will die. Cases and deaths are climbing in many states. I hope the president’s recovery is swift and successful, but our nation’s covered crisis is far, far from over. Today, my prayers are with the families of the 210,000 Americans who died from the virus. All those families who got up this morning and there was an empty chair at the breakfast table, tonight, an empty chair at the dinner table where one should be, husband, wife, son, daughter, mother, father. And nearly 7.5 million Americans- And nearly 7.5 million Americans have been infected with the virus to date. This pandemic and economic collapse has hit the Hispanic communities, particularly hard. Nationally, the infection rate among Hispanics is almost three times higher than white, non Hispanics. More than 40,000 Hispanics have died from COVID-19, devastating families and close knit communities of loved ones. And here in Florida, where Hispanics make up about one quarter of the population, they make up 37% of the COVID deaths. Nearly 3 million Hispanics are unemployed. If you break that down, that last data, unemployment for Hispanic women and Hispanic youth actually went up last month. One in three Hispanic, small business owners have taken a hit and many are likely to have to close permanently. Some economists are calling this what they call a K shaped recovery. It means those at the top, they keep going up, their income. But everyone from the middle and lower-income, it keeps going down, keeps getting worse. Means that essential workers, so many of whom are Hispanic, have sacrificed to keep us going through this pandemic are being left behind by the most unequal recovery in modern American history. Because while workers are struggling, this is a shocking statistic, but it’s true, the top 100 billionaires in America have done pretty well. Just since the COVID crisis they have made an additional $300 billion. The top 100 additional made an additional $300 billion. Everyone else though, they got the bottom half of that K, downward, a downward slide. You’re left to figure out how you’re going to pay your bills, put food on the table, pay the rent, or if you’re lucky enough to own a home, will you have enough money to pay the mortgage? How to balance doing your job with being a teacher to your kids, because their school has gone remote. You’re asked to risk your neck if you can’t work from home, while the risk of COVID are mostly kept outside, because you’re one of our first responders, a union nurse like Ester or on an assembly line, or working in a customer service or tourism industry or at a checkout counter or police office, firefighter. I know this isn’t an easy time, but I also think this pandemic has just helped us rip off the blinders in this country as how inequitable so many things are. People didn’t even realize, and so now they’ve seen it. I truly believe we have a tremendous opportunity to turn this moment of crisis in a moment of great progress for the country. That’s why I’ve laid out a comprehensive agenda, not just to rebuild our communities, but to build them back, make bold investments in them so we can build back better than before the crisis. An independent analysis, President talks about… he loves talking about Wall Street. He never talks about Moody’s on wall street that pointed out, they did a detailed assessment of my economic plan and his. And here’s what Moody’s concluded. They projected my economic plan will create 18.6 million jobs, 7 million more jobs in the president’s economic plan will in four years and $1 trillion more in growth than the president’s plan. And here’s how it works. I’m not going to raise taxes on anyone who makes less than $400,000 a year. You won’t pay a penny more. I guarantee you. But I’m going to ask the big corporations and the super wealthy to begin to pay their fair share. It’s not punishment. It just about time you start paying your fair share. The money we raise from making sure they pay their fair share will allow me to invest it in working people on a growing middle class. When I announced I said I wanted to rebuild the backbone of this country. Working folks, the middle class. They weren’t built by wall street. It was built by labor. Advance racial equity across the economy to make sure everyone is included in the deal this time. We’re going to invest it in creating millions of good paying jobs, union jobs in manufacturing and technology, making sure our future is made in America. In infrastructure, building roads, bridges, highways, ports, and airports like I was able to do when I ran the Recovery Act for our administration, putting billions of dollars in the Port of Miami, creating so good, hard working people with good decent union jobs, able to accommodate the new supertankers coming through the canal, generating some stability. My plan will make sure Hispanic communities benefit from hundreds of billions of dollars in investments, to fill the cracks in the sidewalks, install broadband, close the digital divide, create spaces to live, work, and play in safely. And clean energy. We upgrade 4 million buildings, weatherize 2 million homes. We’ll create, at least, the estimates are at least 1 million good paying jobs and save us millions and millions of barrels of oil. We’re going to meet the threat of climate change and invest in strengthening climate resilience, where we are already dealing with an existential threat of climate change. I don’t have to tell you in Miami, don’t have to tell you in South Florida or in my state, which has the lowest sea level, lowest degree of height from sea level than any state in the nation. Stronger, more frequent hurricanes, rising tides, flooding. And no matter where the president says, maybe you should consider dropping an atomic weapon on a hurricane coming our way is not a good idea. It doesn’t work. Look, that’s not some distant future in Miami or South Florida. You’re dealing with it right now. What do you have to do to get knocked in the head to understand it? We’re going to make sure the small businesses could come out the other side of this crisis with access to capital and the ability to deal with their debts. My plan will get $50 billion in capital flowing to small businesses, which would get repaid in employment and taxes, especially minority owned small businesses and make another $100 billion in low interest loans available to those businesses to get back on their feet and stay alive, because you know as well as I do, and ethnic communities, they are the heartbeat, they’re the center of a community. Whether it’s a grocery store, a beauty shop, the barbershop, the hardware store, the essence of a community. We’re going to make investments to increase incomes as well. It’s long past time. I’ve worked with Governor Cuomo to get it done in New York and other governors across the country. No one should have to work two jobs to be able to be 40 hours a week, so they’re above the poverty rate. $15 should be a minimum wage in the United States of America, period. And for our essential workers, we’re not just going to praise you, we’re going to begin to pay you a good wage, be sure you have strong benefits. We’re going to ease the burden of the major costs in your life. What are they? Healthcare. We’re going to build on the Affordable Care Act, which gave 4 million Hispanic people in this country health insurance, by adding a new health insurance option, a not for profit public option. We’re going to give private insurers a real competitor. We’re going to increase subsidies, so your premiums are lower and you can and afford plans with lower deductibles and lower out-of-pocket expenses. We’re going to take on the pharmaceutical industry, a plan that slashes the cost of prescription drugs by 60%. You think I’m making these numbers up. If we just let Medicare negotiate independently for all the drugs they purchase, I promise you the rates are going to fall through the floor. Affordable and accessible. Every three and four year old will have access to free quality preschool. All the studies at great universities and all the ones around the country have shown that no matter what zip code a child comes from, no matter what background, if they go to preschool, not daycare, preschool in school at three, four, and five years old, they increase exponentially, over by over 50% a prospect they’ll go through all 12 years and many beyond. And we’ll make sure, sure that low and middle-income… and by the way, the total cost of that… it’s called Title 1 program. We now spend $15 billion for in school districts that don’t have high tax rates. Well, guess what? You change that to 45. You can put every one of these kids in school, pay the teachers legitimate rate and make sure that you have school psychologists and social workers in those schools. We’re going to make sure that for childcare, for someone under the age of five or six, no one ever has to pay more than 7% of their income for their young children to get quality childcare, because you truly want to reward work in this country. We have to ease the financial burden of the care that families are carrying. Even before the pandemic, and many of you know it and many of you are doing it, millions of working families faced enormous financial and personal strains, trying to raise their kids and care for their parents or loved ones living with a disability. It’s going to sound strange, when I first got elected, when I was 29 years old to Senate, right after I got elected, my wife and daughter were killed. My two sons survived after hospitalized for a long time. I needed help do my job. I could not possibly afford childcare. Even though I was making a really good salary of $42,000 a year, more than I’d ever made. And I couldn’t afford it. Being a single mom or dad or a family that has two people working with young children, it’s incredibly costly. And by the way, and the professional caregivers out there, home health workers, childcare workers, were more often women, women of color and immigrants, and too often underpaid, unseen and undervalued. That’s why my build back better plan will elevate the compensation, benefits and dignity of caregiver- … Back Better Plan will elevate the compensation benefits and dignity of caregivers and workers and early childhood educators. That’s what we’re going to do. It’s also going to invest in education beyond high school. If you qualify to get into community college, you’ll automatically be able to go, and you’ll be able to go for free. If you are qualified to get into a four-year public school in your state public college, and your family makes less than $125, 000 a year, you get to go free. If you’re buying your first home, you’re going to have a tax credit up to $15,000 to get there. What happened after the Great Recession in this one? An awful lot of you range in age from the millennials have started off back after 9/11, all the way to the people graduating this year… Are not in a position to do that, because your jobs have been postponed or non-existent. But providing an opportunity, I can get you into the system. We’re also going to protect Social Security, increase the benefits for millions of seniors. We’re going to do that all in a partnership and lockstep with the Hispanic community. And by the way, the President’s proposal to eliminate the tax you pay when you get your paycheck for Social Security, without any means by which to replace it, the actuary at social security said Social Security will be bankrupt by 2023. They’ve never liked it to begin with. So look, success and prosperity of the Hispanic Americans is indispensable to the success and prosperity of the United States, and of all America. It’s that simple. Hispanic families are responsible today for $2.6 trillion of our gross domestic product, and growing. If that was a standalone economy, a country all by itself, it would be the eighth largest economy in the world. Think of that. Now imagine how much more that would grow if everyone had access to the tools they need to succeed. By investing in Hispanic communities, we’re making the smartest possible investment with the greatest possible returns that our nation could make, period. We also need to rebuild our ability to work with our partners throughout the Western hemisphere to realize the enormous potential of this region in the world, to confront those leaders who continue to oppress the rights of their people. We should be leading the international effort to confront the massive humanitarian crisis in Venezuela. Maduro, who I’ve met, is a dictator, plain and simple, and he’s causing incredible suffering among the Venezuelan people to maintain his grip on power. The Venezuelan people need our support to recover or their democracy and rebuild their country. That’s why I would immediately grant temporary protective status to Venezuelans as President. So the Republicans in the Senate can’t keep blocking it like they did again just last week. I’ll make sure we’re supporting neighboring countries that are being overrun with immigration because of Maduro, like Columbia, which are caring for millions of Venezuelans who’ve fled their country in desperation. I’ll use sanctions as one of the tools for a comprehensive strategy that includes humanitarian assistance, international pressure, and support for democratic actors in Venezuela to force the regime to embark on the road to a free and fair election. We also need a new Cuba policy. The administration’s approach is not working. Cuba is no closer to freedom and democracy than it was four years ago. The fact there’s more political prisoners, the secret police are as brutal as ever, and Russia is once again a major presence in Cuba in Havana… For my entire career, I strived for democracy and human rights, for freedom of the press, assembly and religion against dictators of the left and the right. As President, my policy will be governed by two principles. First, Americans, especially Cuban-Americans, are the best ambassadors for freedom in Cuba. Second, empowering the Cuban people to determine their own future is central to a national security interest in the United States. I think it’s unconscionable that the current administration is deporting hundreds of Cubans back to a dictatorship. There are almost 10,000 Cubans languishing in tent camps along the Mexican border because the administration’s anti-immigration agenda. That’s the administration actively separating Cuban families by not processing visas, through restrictions on family visits and remittances. I think we have to reverse that. The bottom line is that President Trump can not advance the democracy and human rights for the American people when he has embraced so many autocrats around the world, starting with Vladimir Putin. Folks, we can do this. We can reach for more as a nation. We can rebuild. We can rebuild the backbone of this country and finally bring everybody along. America’s always done best coming out of crisis. We’re the only nation it’s always come out of every crisis better than we went in. We can build a new administration that reflects the full diversity of our nation, including Hispanic communities. And Hispanic voters, especially in Florida, can help put our nation on a new path forward. And here in Florida today as the deadline to register to vote ends today… If you haven’t registered, go out right now because it is an obligation. Every vote will make a difference. Check and make sure your family and friends are registered, and then make sure everyone has a plan to vote. If you can vote by mail, vote by mail. If you can vote in person, vote in person, if you can vote early, vote early. You can vote early in person starting on October 19th in many places in Florida, including right here in Miami. Just make sure you vote. Together we can win. We can’t let this pandemic change everything. We’ve got to get it under control so we can get our economy working again for everyone. We can come together as a nation. I’m running as a Democrat. Proud of it, but I will be an American President, not a democratic President with a capital D. I’ll fight as hard for you and your family whether you vote for me or whether you vote against me because there’s nothing we can’t do when we do it together. Folks, I’ve been other more optimistic about our chances as a nation in the 21st century than I’ve been my whole career. There’s not a single solitary thing that’s beyond our capacities as a nation. I mean that sincerely. The most talented workers in the world… We’re the most incredible system in the world. We have a people, who when they stand together, have never, ever, ever, ever failed. Every time I’d walk out of my grandpa’s house up in Scranton, Pennsylvania, he’d yell, “Joey, keep the faith.” My grandma, when she was alive, would yell back, “No, Joey, spread it.” Let’s go spread the faith. Take back this country. We’re so much better than this. God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you. Thank you. (music) Thank you all for being here. Thank you. I appreciate you being here on this gorgeous day in a magnificent, magnificent setting, until you think about all the lives that were lost here. Please, all have a seat. On July 4th, 1863, American woke to the remains of perhaps the most consequential battle in American soil. It took place here on this ground in Gettysburg; three days of violence, three days of carnage, 50,000 casualties, wounded, captured, missing, or dead, over three days of fighting. When the sun rose on that Independence Day, Lee would retreat. The war would go on for nearly two more years, but the back of the Confederacy had been broken. The Union would be saved. Slavery would be abolished, government of by and for the people would not perish from the earth, and freedom would be born anew in our land. There’s no more fitting place than here today in Gettysburg, to talk about the cost of division. About how much it has cost America in the past, about how much it is costing us now, and about why I believe in this moment, we must come together as a nation. For President Lincoln, the Civil War was about the greatest of causes. The end of slavery, widening equality, pursuit of justice, the creation of opportunity, and the sanctity of freedom. His words would live ever after. We hear them in our heads. We know them in our hearts. We draw on them when we seek hope in hours of darkness; “Four score, and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.” Here on this sacred ground, Abraham Lincoln, re-imagined America itself. Here, a president of the United States spoke of the price of division, and the meaning of sacrifice. He believed in the rescue, redemption, and rededication of the union. All this in a time, not just of ferocious division, but of widespread death, structural inequity, and fear of the future. And he taught us this, a house divided could not stand. That is a great and timeless truth. Today, once again, we are a house divided, but that my friends can no longer be. We’re facing too many crises. We have too much work to do. We have to bright a future to have it shipwrecked on the Shoals of anger and hate, and division. As we stand here today, a century and a half later after Gettysburg, we should consider again, what can happen when equal justice is denied, when anger and violence and division are left unchecked. As I look across America today, I’m concerned. The country is in a dangerous place. Our trust in each other is ebbing. Hope seems elusive. Too many Americans see our public life, not as an arena for mediation of our differences, but rather they see it as an occasion for total, unrelenting, partisan warfare. Instead of treating each other’s party as the opposition, we treat them as the enemy. This must end. We need to revive the spirit of bipartisanship in this country. A spirit of being able to work with one another. When I say that, and I’ve been saying it for two years now, I’m accused of being naive. I’m told, “Maybe that’s the way things used to work, Joe, but they can’t work that way anymore.” Well, I’m here to tell you they can, and they must if we’re going to get anything done. I’m running as a proud Democrat, but I will govern as an American president. I’ll work with Democrats and Republicans. I’ll work as hard for those who don’t support me, as those who do. That’s the job of a president; the duty to care for everyone. It was a lot of Democrats and Republicans to cooperate with one another is not due to some mysterious force beyond our control. It’s a decision. It’s a choice we make. And if we can decide not to cooperate, we can decide to cooperate as well. That’s the choice I’ll make as president. But there’s something bigger going on in this nation than just our broken politics. Something darker, something more dangerous. I’m not talking about ordinary differences of opinion, competing viewpoints give life and vibrancy to our democracy. No, I’m talking about something different, something deeper. Too many Americans seek not to overcome our divisions, but to deepen them, we must seek not to build walls, but bridges. We must seek not to have our fist clenched, but our arms open. We have to seek not to tear each other apart, we seek to come together. You don’t have to agree with me on everything, or even on most things, to see that we’re experiencing today is neither good nor normal. I made the decision to run for president after Charlottesville. Close your eyes, and remember what you saw. Neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and the KKK coming out of the fields with torches light, veins bulging, chanting the same anti-Semitic bile herd across Europe in the ’30s. It was hate on the march, in the open, in America. Hate never goes away, it only hides. And when it’s given oxygen, when it’s given an opportunity to spread, when it’s treated as normal and acceptable behavior, we’ve opened a door in this country that we must move quickly to close. As president, that’s just what I will do. I will send a clear unequivocal message to the entire nation, there is no place for hate in America. It will be given no license. It will be given no oxygen. It’ll be given no safe harbor. In recent weeks and months, the country has been riled by instances of excessive police force, heart-wrenching cases of racial injustice and lives needlessly and senselessly lost, by peaceful protesters, given voice to the calls for justice, by examples of violence and looting and burning that can not be tolerated. I believe in law and order, I’ve never supported defunding the police. But I also believe injustice is real. It’s a product of a history that goes back 400 years, the moment when black men, women, and children first were brought here in chains. I do not believe we have to choose between law and order, and racial justice in America. We can have both. This is the nation strong enough to both honestly face systemic racism and strong enough to provide safe streets for our families and small businesses. The two often bear the brunt of this looting and burning. We have no need for armed militias roaming America’s streets, and we should have no tolerance for extremist white supremacy groups, menacing our communities. If you say, “We should trust America’s law enforcement authorities to do the job,” as I do, then let them do their job without extremist groups acting as vigilantes. If you say, “We have no need to face racial injustice in the country,” you haven’t opened your eyes to the truth in America. There’ve been powerful voices for justice in recent weeks and months, George Floyd’s, six year old daughter, who I met with, who looked at me and said in her small child’s voice, “Daddy changed the world.” Also, Jacob Blake’s mother was another. When she said, “Violence didn’t reflect her son and this nation needed healing.” And Doc Rivers, the basketball coach, choking back tears when he said, “We’re the ones getting killed. We’re the ones getting shot. We’ve been hung. It’s amazing  we keep loving this country and this country does not love us back.” I think about that. I think about what it takes for a black person to love America. That is a deep love for this country. That has for far too long, never been recognized. What we need in America’s leadership that seeks to deescalate tensions, to open lines of communications, to bring us together, to heal, to hope. As president, that’s precisely what I will do. We paid a high price for allowing the deep divisions in this country to impact on how we deal with the Coronavirus. 210,000 Americans dead, and the number’s climbing. It’s estimated that nearly another 210,000 Americans could lose their lives by the end of the year; enough, no more. Let’s just set partisanship aside, let’s end the politics and follow the science. Wearing a mask is not a political statement. It’s a scientific recommendation. Social distancing isn’t a political statement. It’s a scientific recommendation. Testing, tracing, the development and all approval and distribution of a vaccine, isn’t a political statement. It is a science-based decision. We can’t undo what has been done. We can’t go back. We can do so much better. We can do better starting today. We can have a national strategy that puts politics aside and saves lives. We can have a national strategy that will make it possible for our schools and business to open safely. We can have a national strategy that reflects the true values of this nation. This pandemic is not a red state or blue state issue. This virus doesn’t care whether you live, or where you live, what political party you belong to, it affects us all. It will take anyone’s life. It’s a virus. It’s not a political weapon. There’s another enduring division in America that we must end, the division in our economic life. That gives opportunity only to the privileged few. America has to be about mobility. It has to be the kind of country where an Abraham Lincoln, a child of the distant frontier, can rise to the highest office in the land. America has to be about possibilities. The possibility of prosperity, not just for the privileged few, but for the many, for all of us. Working people on their kids deserve an opportunity. Lincoln knew this. He said that the country had to give people, and I quote, “An open field and a fair chance. An open field and a fair chance.” That’s what we’re going to do in America. We’re going to build together. We fought a civil war that would secure a union that would seek to fulfill the promise of equality for all. And by fits and starts, our better angels had prevailed again, just enough, just enough against our worst impulses to make a new and better nation. And those better angels can prevail again, now. They must prevail again, now. 100 years after Lincoln spoke at Gettysburg, the vice president, Lyndon B Johnson also came here, and here’s what he said. He said, “Our nation founded soul and honor in these fields of Gettysburg, we must not lose that soul in dishonor, now, on the fields of hate.” Today, we’re engaged, once again, in the battle for the soul of the nation, the forces of darkness, the forces of division, the forces of yesterday are pulling us apart, holding us down and holding us back. We must free ourselves of all of them. As president, I will embrace hope, not fear. Peace, not violence. Generosity, not greed. And light, not darkness. I’ll be a president who appeals to the best in us, not the worst. I’ll be a president who pushes toward the future, not one who clings to the past. I’m ready to fight for you and for our nation every day, without exception, without reservation, with a full and devoted heart. We cannot, and will not, allow extremest and white supremacist to overturn the America of Lincoln and Harriet Tubman, and Frederick Douglas, to overturn the America that has welcomed immigrants from distant shores, to overturn the America that has been a Haven and a home for everyone, no matter their background. From Seneca falls to Selma, to Stonewall we’re at our best when the promise of America is available to all, we cannot, and we will not allow violence in the street to threaten the people of this nation. We cannot and will not walk away from our obligation to at long last, face the wrecking on race and racial justice in this country. We cannot and will not continue to be struck in the partisan politics that lets us, this virus, thrive, while the public health of this nation suffers. We cannot and will not accept an economic equation that only favors those who have already got it made; everybody deserves a shot at prosperity. Folks, duty and history call presidents to provide for the common good, and I will. It won’t be easy. Won’t be easy. Our divisions today are long standing, economic and racial inequities have shaped us for generations, but I give you my word. I give you my word. If I’m elected president, I will Marshall the ingenuity and Goodwill of this nation to turn division into unity and bring us together because I think people are looking for that. We can disagree about how as we move forward, we must take the first steps. It starts with how we treat one another. How we talk to one another. How we respect one another. In the second inaugural Lincoln said, “With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right, as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we’re in to build up the nation’s wounds, bind up the nation’s wounds.” Now, we have our work to reunite America. To bind up our nation’s wounds. To move past shadow and suspicion. And so we, you and I together, we press on, even now. After hearing the second inaugural address, Frederick Douglas told President Lincoln, “Mr. Lincoln, that was a sacred effort.” We have to be dedicated to our own sacred effort. The promise of Gettysburg and the new birth of freedom was in hand. I think it’s at risk. Every generation that’s followed Gettysburg has been faced with a moment when it must answer this question, will they allow the sacrifices made here to be in vain, or be fulfilled? This is our moment to answer this essential American question, for ourselves and for our time. And my answer is this, it cannot be that after all this country has been through, after all that America’s accomplished, after all the years, we have stood as a beacon of light to the world. It cannot be that here and now in 2020, we will allow the government of the people, by the people, and for the people to perish this earth. No, it cannot. And it must not. We have it in our hands, the ultimate power. The power to vote. Its the note instrument ever devised to register our will in a peaceable and productive fashion. And so we must. We must vote. We will vote. No matter how many obstacles are thrown in our way, because once America votes, America will be heard. Lincoln said, “The nation is worth fighting for.” So it was. And so it is, together as one nation under God, indivisible. Let us join forces to fight the common foe of injustice and inequality, hate and fear. Let’s conduct ourselves as Americans who love each other, who love our country, who will not destroy, but will build. We owe it to the dead who were buried here at Gettysburg. We owe that to the living, and to future generations yet to be born. You and I are part of a covenant, a common story of divisions overcome and hope renewed. If we do our part, if we stand together, if we keep faith with the past and with each other, then the divisions of our time will give way to the dreams of a brighter, better future. This is our work. This is our pledge. This is our mission. We can end this era of division. We can end the hate and the fear. We can be what we are at our best, the United States of America. God bless you all. And may God protect our troops. Thank you. We can do this. I’ll tell you. And I asked her, “Is that my sister?” I said, “Yeah, yeah.” Look, the thing I love about being here, and it’s been about a year since September I was here last at this very spot, is the one thing we have in common. I mean, this sincerely. I first ran for the United States Senate years ago and I had one billboard. It said, “For all our families.” For real, that’s all it said. All my literature, “For all our families.” And the thing I love about you all, it’s all about family. It’s about family. It’s about family and faith and loyalty, and that’s what I think every time I think you here. And so I want to thank you. Now, I’ll tell you what, Edgar planned on bringing in 20 horses in here, but he couldn’t get them in today. Tell you what, I’ve had people campaign for me but never had them go through the neighbors with me on horses. But my dad, who was a real equestrian, would have really been flattered to know you’re doing this. Folks, look, it’s great to be back at the center and I don’t have to tell you all, there’s so much at stake. And here we are, we’ve gone through so much since I was here last, because of the incompetence of this administration. 210,000 people dead. We’re in a situation where that’s 40,000 Latinos nationwide, 40,000. 30 million people lost their jobs. Three million Latinos lost their jobs. One in three Latino businesses have closed, and the deep racial injustices that Trump continues to fan the flames of. It’s just wrong. We have to end this cycle where in good times, you’re being left behind. In bad times, you’re the first in trouble, and as we come out, always the last to come out. This crisis, we have I think though an enormous opportunity to build back better. I’m going to be very short, so I’m not going to keep you standing very long. Don’t worry. But I really feel strongly about this. I think we’re in a circumstance where you all understand it, but the American public is beginning to understand it. You are the core of the American story. You have a potential. You’re already an economic powerhouse, but the potential to lead the country in the 21st century into the direction that we need to go. You have close to 20% of the population in the United States, 24 out of every 100 kids in grade school through high school are Latino, and it’s ridiculous that we continue to policies that this administration has moved forward on and not embrace that and see it as our future. I’m not trying to be solicitous with it. I’m not trying to be nice. You are the future of the country. I mean, you really are. If, in fact, we’re in a situation where the Latino community in the United States of America and the GDP, the wealth that they generate nationwide, if we just took just the Latino population, you’d be the eighth largest economy in the world, in the United States. Why can’t we see that the future is just absolutely breathtaking if we just use our heads and begin to operate in a way that I think the American people are ready to do? The blinders have been taken off the American people. They get it. They understand. They understand that all those folks in the front lines, look at how many dreamers are out there risking their lives? I mean, you know it, but the American people don’t know it, and I keep telling them all over the country. The dreamers, there’s thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of them risking their lives, making sure that people are staying alive, they can stay home. And so, folks, look, we’re going to be in a situation where we can’t make this, we can’t do it without you all. We cannot win without the community. And I’m going to say something somewhat self-serving about you all. The fact is you can determine the outcome of this election, not just, not just for President, but for the Senate, for the Congress. And that’s the biggest mark, the single most consequential thing anyone can do is vote. And when you vote and they add it up and they see who delivered the vote, that’s the thing that guarantees significant input on what happens next. So folks, early voting starts. The clock is ticking. Voting starts here in just eight days on the 17th and I’d encourage you to tell all your friends. Go to Iwillvote.com now. Make sure they’re registered, their addresses are up to date on the ballot, and they have a plan to vote in the early voting right here, right at this spot. So come back next weekend, bring your family, and bring five friends. I really mean it. Bring other people with you, because he’s trying to scare us. He’s trying to convince everybody there’s ways they can play with the vote and undermine the vote. They can’t. If we show up, we win. And look what’s happened in early voting all across America. Long lines, long lines. We can’t just win, we have to win overwhelmingly, so he can’t be in a position where you can put the phony challenges that he’s talking about. So, folks, the American people, they’re the ones who decide our future, not this President and Attorney General, who is less than straightforward. You’re the ones. So let’s get out and vote. I know the sun is hot. I don’t want to keep you standing. And I want to thank the elected officials. This we call a bus man’s holiday. That means when a bus man has a holiday, he has the day off, the guy driving, he doesn’t get back on the bus. Well, these folks are all on the bus. They’re elected officials. They’re another elected official. I can’t thank you enough for your support. I give you my word I will do everything in my power to deliver on all that I’ve said. I mean it from my heart. You are family. Family and faith are what’s driven this community and is going to drive this country. And so, folks, let’s go get them. This is off. I guess I should have stayed where I was. My grand pop was not Hispanic. He was an Irishman. And every time I’d walk out of his door up in Scranton, Pennsylvania, he’d say, “Joey, keep the faith.” My grand mum, when she was alive, would yell, “No, Joey. Spread it!” Let’s go spread the faith, okay? Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. By the way, I promise you, if I win, you’re getting an invitation to Washington, okay? Not a joke, not a joke. Thank you. You’re the best. Hello, hello, hello, hello. Thank you, thank you, thank you. It’s good to be back in Erie. I want to say hello to all of Erie. But mainly Mr.Mayor, City Council President Horton, and all local elected leaders who are joining us here today. And to your next Senator, Julie. We need to turn out and support for Democrats down the line here in Pennsylvania and win back that Pennsylvania state Senate. Folks, look. I want to thank you President McManus for coming out, you’ve been a good friend a long time. And for everyone at the UA for hosting this incredible training facility. I’m so grateful to have earned UA’s endorsement. You have over 355 proud plumbers, pipe fitters, and more behind me then I can possibly thank you for. Also, want to thank Rick for sharing his story with us today. And for being part of a conversation this year where he shared a story with America. And Rick, Delaware is thought of as being a great corporate entity, and chemical facilities, and all those things. But we have a $4 billion, as you probably well know, agricultural industry in the Delmarva Peninsula. It’s a big deal and a lot of farmers are being hurt really badly, really badly. Farmers all across the country have been gutted by the president’s broken promises and reckless trade war. But our farmers, just like our union members and anyone who actually does an honest day’s work, see him and his promises for what they are. Rick, I want to thank you. And I think you put it best in the op-ed you wrote last year. You said, “It’s a bunch of hot air and cold wind.” Folks, this is it. Election’s here. The choice couldn’t be more stark. The stakes couldn’t be higher. So many Pennsylvanians are facing hard times right now. After my debate in Cleveland last week I took a train. That’s what I’ve ridden a lot, an Amtrak train. From northeastern Ohio into Pittsburgh and Greensburg, Latrobe, Johnstown. And I heard the same stories everywhere, I’ve been hearing all around the country. You’re trying your best but it never feels like enough. You’re not looking for a handout. You’re just looking for a fair shot. That’s how my dad felt when we had to leave Scranton after it was no work, when coal died. He was in sales, he wasn’t a guy who was in the coal mines. Although my great-grandfather was, they tell me, the first Irish Catholic State Senator ever elected in the state of Pennsylvania, and he was a mining engineer. But I remember him saying he made that walk, which a lot of you know here in Erie. I call it the longest walk any parent has to make up a short flight of stairs to tell his kids we can’t play in that ball camp, can’t play in Green Ridge Little League anymore. You can’t go to St.Paul’s, you got to leave. Dad doesn’t have a job. I’m going to have to leave. I remember him taking us home, my mom and three children at the time, home to my grandpop’s. And I don’t know how much pride it must’ve cost him to ask my grandfather, “Will you take care of Jean and the kids? I’ll be back.” And he started commuting every weekend 157 miles down to Delaware where he had grown up. We ended up in a steel town called Claymont, Delaware. Then we went to Wilmington. My dad got a sales job and he worked hard. Took about four years to build a decent middle class life and be able to buy a home. But it wasn’t easy for him, but he had an expression. He said, “Joey, I don’t expect the government to solve my problems, but I at least expected them to understand my problems.” America deserves a president who understands what people are going through. You’re facing real challenges right now. And the last thing you need is a president who exacerbates them. More than 210,000 are dead, as was pointed out. We lose anywhere from 700 to a thousand people a day, dead. The president was told a little while ago… When he was told a 100,000 people a day were dying, you know what he said? He says, “It is what it is.” Well, it is what it is because he is who he is. More than 7.5 million Americans have been infected, and counting. 175,000 cases right here in Pennsylvania. My heart goes out to all those families who, like any of us have lost a child’s spirit, look at that empty chair at the dining room table tonight where somebody you love used to sit. My heart goes out to everyone struggling in this economic crisis. Simple neglect on the part of this administration. There’re 11 million jobs lost since the beginning of this crisis and still have not come back. Temporary layoffs have turned into permanent layoffs. We’re still down 674,000 manufacturing jobs nationwide since the crisis started, and more than 40,000 manufacturing jobs here in Pennsylvania. The Trump presidency will be the first presidency since Hoover that is going to end up leaving office with fewer jobs than when he came into office. Since Hoover. But President Trump has laid… He talks about this V recovery. We went down real quick, we’re coming up quick. Well, that’s what you call a K-shape recovery. Those folks on the top of the K are doing very, very well. Recession at the top, those folks, everything’s going up for them. But everybody in the middle and below is going down, seeing things get worse. It means essential workers who sacrificed to keep us going through this pandemic are being left behind by the most unequal recovery in American history. And it means while the top… This is a fact, which is startling to me when I found it out. The top 100 billionaires, in the middle of this pandemic they made $300 billion additional dollars. Hear me now? 100 individuals made $300 billion this year. And what’d the bottom half get? They got the K, they got the slide down. Because the fact is, the President can only see the world from Park Avenue. I see it from Scranton. I see it from Claymont, for real. You all know what I’m talking about. You all see it from Erie. That’s why my program to build back better is focused on working people. Think about it. Think about all the people you know who got up this morning and had the following conversation. “Honey, I know we need four new tires, they’re bald. But we can’t do it now, we got to wait. You got to wait.” Or “I know we just lost our insurance, but we’re going to be okay. We’re going to hang in there.” Or having to make a choice, literally a choice, between getting the prescription or putting food on the table. If I said to that 10 years ago you’d look at me like I was writing a fiction story, but that’s the truth. Those are decisions people are making today, right now. Independent analysis put out by a highly respected Wall Street firm of all things, Moody’s from Wall Street firm, projects that my build back better plan’s going to create 18.6 million jobs in four years. That’s harder now. That’s not a liberal think tank, that’s Moody’s. And it’s going to create seven million more jobs than the president’s economic plan. And a trillion dollars more in economic growth than the president’s plan. And here’s how it works, I’m going to raise taxes. I’m not going to raise taxes on anybody making less than $400K, but you won’t pay a penny more. But those making more than that, I’m going to ask them to finally begin to pay the fair share. I’m going to ask the big corporations and the wealthy to begin to pay. 91 of the fortune 500 companies today pay zero tax. You hear me? Zero tax. How many of you pay zero tax? And billionaires are paying at a tax rate… Because it’s all investment money, they’re paying a lower tax rate than you pay if you have a job as a plumber. How can that be? So I’m going to raise. The money I’m going to raise, we’re going to allow us to invest in working people and grow the middle-class back, and make sure everyone comes along this time. My plan is about making the kinds of investments that are going to stimulate economic growth. To get it back to full employment fast and help us build back better than before. We’re going to create millions of good paying union jobs. I had the honor of being the guy in charge of the Recovery Act when the Great Recession occurred. The president turned to me, he used to love doing it at State of the Union messages. He’d never tell me what he was going to do. And he turns, says “And Joe, sheriff Joe’s going to take care of that $800 billion.” Well, we got it done less than two tenths of 1% waste or fraud. And we built back the longest expansion in American history. Manufacturing and technology, making sure we’re going to make the future made in America. And infrastructure, building: airports, schools, affordable housing, upgrading the water and pipes. Making sure it’s sustainable and resilient, built, laid down by union plumbers and pipe fitters here in Pennsylvania and across the country. And clean energy, we’re going to upgrade four million buildings with weatherization of two million homes. And it’s estimated that’ll create one million good paying jobs, union jobs. Union jobs to be filled by men and women like in this local here. Look folks, we’re in a situation now where if you take a look at this build back better… I’m going to take a second. But I hope I don’t take too many seconds before it rains here. Number one, we were talking about it, Mr.President, a little while ago. He promised an infrastructure plan in 2016, ’17, ’18, ’19. He didn’t do a damn thing. Not one single bit. He promised to relieve main street slammed by the recession. But guess where that money went, that the Congress passed? It went into the Mar-a-Lago crowd, the wealthy. See, I’m not joking. It didn’t go to small businesses. It didn’t go to the people that needed it. My plan to revitalize American manufacturing infrastructure says we’re going to use by American. We’re supposed to be only buying American now. Well, I’m going to invest $2 trillion in infrastructure and clean energy. We’re going to raise over $3.7 trillion by eliminating that tax cut for the super wealthy. And folks, we’re going to: fix water pipes, pipelines, replace lead pipes, upgrade treatment plants. We’re going to construct 1.5 million new affordable housing units. We’re going to build a $100 billion dollars rebuilding our schools. We’re going to retrofit, which we started in our administration, 4 million buildings; including advanced heating and cooling system. There’s going to be such a race to job creation for unions that you’re not going to believe it, and I really mean this. And by the way, when I did the Recovery Act, which is $800 billion, not one… We had the largest infrastructure project short of Eisenhower’s Interstate Highway Program; since that. Not one single solitary dollar went to anything other than a prevailing wage. Had to be a prevailing wage. Look, I’m also going to make sure that corporate America being so kind, wanting to take over registered apprenticeships… You know what that’s all about? You guys spend a quarter billion dollars a year making sure that you have apprenticeships that are the best trained people in the world. Well folks, I’m also going to pass the PRO Act. They’re spending over $2 billion a year trying to keep you from being able to organize around the country. That’s a promise. And also strengthen labor standards, especially OSHA rules. There’s a lot we can do, but it’s not enough to praise workers. We got to make sure they get benefited. Folks, look, my dad had another expression. After he lost his job, we moved to Delaware. He’d say, “Joey, a job’s about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about your dignity. It’s about respect. It’s about your place in the community. It’s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, ‘Honey, it’s going to be okay.'” The fact is that every time the word climate change comes up Donald Trump thinks hoax. Every time it comes up, I think jobs. Let me be clear, no matter how many lies he tells, I am not, not, not banning fracking; period. We’ll also increase incomes. We’re going to see the burden and the cost with an increased 50, we’re going to make sure. Not prevailing wage. We can’t mandate that, you guys. By the way, I said inside, the other expression my dad had was, “There’s only one way to deal with the abuse of power.” Which corporate America is exercising now. “It’s with power.” And the only power we have is union power. You’re the guys that keep the ball bearings on the other side of the gate from taking everything, and that’s a fact. So look, I’ll try to move along quickly here. The fact is that we not ease the burden on the major costs in your life. What’s the average middle-class person fear most? They’re trying to tear down the Affordable Care Act. We’re going to build on it, adding a new health insurance option. A not-for-profit public option, which is going to give private insurers real competition. We’re going to increase the subsidies so premiums are lower and we can afford plans with lower deductibles and lower out-of-pocket expenses. Because we’re going to be able to do that with the money we take back from the super wealthy. We’re going to take on the pharmaceutical companies with a plan that slashes the cost of prescription drugs by 60%. Look folks, we’re going to work with states to ensure that every three, four, and five year old has access to free high quality preschool, not daycare. You send them to preschool, there’s evidence of 58% of them will go all the way through. No matter what their background. No matter what poor school, poor neighbor they come from. You start them at age three, they have a 58% better chance of graduating all the way through high school and beyond. We’re going to make sure the low and middle income families will never have to spend more than 7% of their income caring for their young. What’s the comp… Talk to the women around here. I was a single dad for five years. I couldn’t afford help. I thank God I had my mom, and my sister, and my brother to help me with my kids when my wife and daughter were killed. We’re going to make four year public college and universities tuition free for families making less than $125,000 a year. And when Erie gets his first new community college to open in Pennsylvania in 27 years, we’re going to make sure that it’s free for anyone who qualifies to get in. That’s a fact. And by the way, that costs a lot of money. That costs $6 billion a year. That’s about as much as we give a tax deduction for race horses. I mean this, we got to have priorities. If you’re buying your first home? Look at all people who’ve gotten out of school since the 9/11 generation. Where they got out of high school without a graduation. Where they got out of college, no graduations. Where they thought they had these good jobs waiting for them, but they all got shut down in the Great Recession. And now, what are they doing? They’re unable to make that first home down payment. They’re out there busting their neck. And a lot of them are college graduates, some of them are beyond that. Some of have their graduate degrees and no jobs, or no access. Well, I’m going to make sure you get a tax credit for up to $15,000 for your first time home buyer; period. That’s going to provide you a down payment. We’re going to protect social security, increase benefits for millions of seniors. So he can retire with dignity in some respect. Folks look, but if we’re going to get anything done, we’ve got to come together. We’re going to have to vote like we’ve never voted before. Early voting is open here in Pennsylvania. So go vote if you can. And go to IWillVote.com/pa to find out when and where you can vote early. And if you requested a mail in ballot, return it as soon as possible. Make sure you seal it first in the secrecy envelope, and then sign the declaration on the outside of the envelope before you return it. As I said early this week on the sacred grounds of Gettysburg battlefield, I’m running as a proud Democrat, but I’m going to govern as an American president. I’m going to work as hard for those who don’t support me as those who do. And I’m so proud in this campaign to have earned the support of so many proud and patriotic Republicans, including Pennsylvania’s former governor and secretary of Homeland Security, Tom Ridge. I want to thank him publicly for his endorsement. We may not in everything. We agree on this. This is a moment to put country above party. Because after all this country’s been through, after all that America has accomplished, after all the years we’ve stood as a beacon for the rest of the world. It cannot be that here in the year 2020 we’ll allow the government of the people, by the people, and for the people, to perish on this earth; as Lincoln said. We can do better. We can do better than what we’ve seen. We can be what we are at our best, the United States of America. All this division being pushed by this president, all this stuff about encouraging… Here in the debate we had I ask him to condemn the Proud Boys. He said, “Stand back and stand down, but stand ready.” What’s going on here? This is not who we are. This is not who we are as a country, for real. We can argue like hell, but end of the day we come together. I am more optimistic about America’s chances today than I ever been. Why? Because I think the blinders have been taken off, people have realized what’s really at stake here. I think we can pull this together. I’m optimistic. I really genuinely am. But here’s the deal guys, we got to go out and make sure you vote. Because, the only way we lose this is by the chicanery going on relative to polling places. This whole idea… Not a single solitary reasonable person in either party has said mail-in ballots are corrupt. No evidence, but he’s trying to make it sound that way. Trying to put people in polling places. The same guys you saw standing blocking people’s way in Virginia with banners and rifles slung across their shoulders. Folks, it’s not who we are. We’re so much better than this. So I say to you all, God bless you all. Let’s go out and vote. And may God protect our troops. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Appreciate it. Thank you. Where am I going? Am I going this way? Thanks everybody. See you pal, thanks a million. Thank you! The other way, . Well, I’ll tell you what. My dad was an automobile man. I got through school, and we got through being able to eat after he lost his job up in Scranton, Pennsylvania. He had to move down to Delaware, because selling General Motors products. So I’ve known, and my state used to have the largest percentage of auto workers of any state in the nation, because we had a small population and the largest General Motors and largest Chrysler plant outside of Michigan and Ohio. I saw what happened when we got hit very hard. We’ve lost both those plants. Well, let me start off by saying, Mr. Mayor, thanks for the passport into your city, and Marcy, you’ve been a friend a long time. Thank you for your introduction. There’s no more fierce defender. There’s no more fierce defender, the people she grew up with, than Marcy. She has never, ever, ever forgotten where she came from. She’s tough. She’s a straight shooter. She’s influential in Congress. She’s honest, and she sees you. You’re always in her view. Tony, Mr. President, I know you’re new, and he says, “Piece of cake.” So I don’t have to worry if I get elected the first 100 days. But all kidding aside, Tony, thank you for hosting us, and thank you, Local 14. , thanks for that introduction. All you did for Barack and me when we were running, when we got elected, jumping in and being part of helping us govern, you remind me of something my dad said. He said, “Joey, a job’s about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about your dignity. It’s about your place in the community. It’s about respect. It’s about being able to say to your kid, look them in the eye and say, ‘Everything’s going to be okay’ and mean it. That’s what a job’s about, a decent paying job like the UAW provides.” This lesson I grew up with, surrounded by hard work and families in Scranton and then in Claymont, Delaware, where we had to move when Dad lost work. There was no work in Scranton, just like here in Toledo, but the times are hard. Unemployment is way up due to the pandemic and the terrible way in which it’s been handled. The economic outlook remains uncertain. Across Ohio and the country, folks are worried about making their next mortgage payment or their rent payment, whether or not they can purchase their prescription drugs or be able to put food on the table, literally worried about whether their kids’ schools open and be able to stay open and, if they’re not open, how they can go to work, if they have a job, and still take care of their kids. They see the people at the very top doing better than they ever have while they’re left to wonder, “Who’s looking out for me?” That’s Donald Trump’s presidency, 215,000 dead because of COVID. Experts say we’re likely to lose another 200,000 people in the next few months unless we take some serious action. He doesn’t know what he’s doing, all because this president’s only worried about one thing: the stock market. They refuse to follow the science. It’s estimated that if we just wore these masks nationally, we’d save over 100,000 lives between now and the end of the year. This president knew back in January. He was briefed in detail by the intelligence community how extremely dangerous this COVID virus was, how communicable the disease was. He went on a taped interview with Bob Woodward, a leading journalist. It’s on tape. It’s been played, telling Woodward that he knew how dangerous the disease was, but did nothing. Ask yourself, “Why didn’t he tell us? Why didn’t he warn us?” He said nothing. He told Woodward he didn’t want it panic the American people. That’s why he said nothing. We don’t panic. America doesn’t panic. But Trump panicked. His reckless personal conduct since his diagnosis has been unconscionable. The longer Donald Trump is President, the more reckless he seems to get. Dr. Fauci, the most respected doc on this issue in the world, in the country, he told the president … You know the president’s announcement of his pick for the Supreme Court in the Rose Garden? He’s referred to that as a super spreader. All those people got the disease. How’s he responding? Well, guess what? He’s now running an ad you probably saw, a national ad quoting Dr. Fauci out of context. Way back in March, referring to public health officials, Dr. Fauci said, “I can’t imagine that anybody could be doing more,” end of quote. In the recent ad that’s going out nationally, Trump quotes Dr. Fauci is saying that about him, the president. Trump and his campaign deliberately lied, making it sound like Fauci was talking about Trump. Fauci went on to the public air when the ad came out saying, three days ago, “I did not get permission for that quote.” He wasn’t referring to the president. Even after that, Fauci said he didn’t say that. The president and the campaign, even after Fauci laid this out, the campaign said, “We’re still going to use it, because he did say it, even though it wasn’t about him.” The point I’m trying to make is it was a knowing lie, like we’re being told about everything about this COVID consequences. As a consequence, through his months of overwhelming lying, misleading and irresponsible action on the part of Donald Trump, how many empty chairs were around your breakfast table this morning? Someone you love, somebody you cared about, someone you knew, a family member or a neighbor, missing, missing. Why? Because of negligence. Look, I view this campaign, as I’ve said before and I’ll say it again, between Scranton and Park Avenue, between Toledo and Park Avenue. All Trump can see from Park Avenue is Wall Street. That’s why his only metric for American prosperity that he values is the Dow Jones and the index. Like a lot of you, I spent a lot of my time with guys like Trump looking down on me, the Irish Catholic kid in the neighborhood, guys who thought they were better than me because they had a lot of money, guys who inherited everything they ever got and still managed to squander it. I have to admit I shouldn’t have done it, but I’ve on record saying, and so I’ll repeat it, I still have a little bit of a chip on my shoulder about guys like him. I read some stories after I got the nomination that quote, “If Biden gets elected, he’ll be the first non-Ivy League school graduate to get elected in” …  it was 80 or 90 years. Guys, have a seat, man. You know what? Like some state school guy who went to the University of Delaware, I was proud of it. Hard to get there, hard to get through in terms of money. But folks, since when can someone who went to a state university not be qualified to be President? Folks, I know what it takes to be President. I sat next to a man for eight years, watching and participating. My mom taught me what you’re probably taught by your parents, too. She said, “Joey, nobody is better than you, but everybody’s your equal.” I don’t measure people based on the size of their bank account. I don’t respect people based on whether they own a mansion. I don’t judge them based on whether they belong to a country club. You and I measure people by the strength of their character, their honesty, their courage, their courage. My mom used to say, “The greatest gift of all, the greatest virtue is courage. You’re redeemed by your courage.” That’s what she’d say, and redeemed by your loyalty, honesty, loyalty, things that are bigger than yourself or the neighborhoods we were raised in. It’s all about family, decency, honor, opportunity. These are the values I learned growing up in Scranton, my guess is you learn growing up in Toledo, wherever you grew up. The people I grew up with in Scranton didn’t have any money in stocks. In our house, growing up, every penny my dad made went to paying the bills, keeping the lights on and food on the table. Every penny our friends in Scranton made went to paying the bills and taking care of their families as well. We looked out for our neighbors. That’s why I have a different measure by which I judge the health of America’s economy. I see hardworking women and men who are just trying to earn an honest living and take care of their families, just want an even shot. They’re not asking for anything. They’re just asking for a fair shot, and given a shot, the American people will never, ever, ever, ever let their country down, never. The other expression my dad would have, he’d say, “When you see the abuse of power, there’s only one way to respond to it, and that’s with power.” The only power we have to take on corporate America is union power. That’s the only power. I just think back to 2008, when Barack and I were elected and we inherited the worst recession short of a depression in history. The president put me in charge of the Recovery Act, $800 billion. It was needed to save our economy from going into depression. We did it with less than two-tenths of 1% waste or fraud. We were able to see to it that Ohio and other states received substantial assistance to address their economic pain and recover and rebuild, to make sure we kept teachers, firefighters, and cops, public nurses on the job. People are being laid off now because you don’t have the local money to do it. So they didn’t have to be fired because of lack of money. That was the federal government stepped up, and it started the longest sustained economic recovery in American history that this guy inherited and then squandered again. But you know what Mitch McConnell said recently about helping the states and cities. He said, quote, “Let them go bankrupt.” Well, I heard that before. You heard it, too. Republicans said the same thing about the automobile industry. Like I said, I come from an automobile state, an automobile man. The auto industry that supported one in eight Ohioans was on the brink. It was more than ten years ago, but you remember like it was yesterday. It was on the brink. But Barack and I bet on you and the American worker, and it paid off. I argued the American worker was the finest auto worker in the world. Management screwed it up. You didn’t. You didn’t make the mistake. By the way, it all got paid back. But guess who made the greatest sacrifices? Auto workers. You made the sacrifices to get it back. So it’s over the many objections of many that we stepped in and rescued the automobile industry, General Motors and Chrysler, saving one million jobs. Then what happened when Donald Trump came to office? Remember what Trump said in 2017 in Lordstown? He said, “Don’t move,” quote, “Don’t move. Don’t sell your house.” But Lordstown shut down on Trump’s watch. After a decade in Cleveland, after the debate in Cleveland, I met with an elementary school teacher in Lordstown. Her husband was there as well, one of the workers who lost his job in Lordstown. He had to accept a transfer to a plan in Kentucky, eight hours away, one way, to maintain his healthcare and his pension. He drives 16 hours a weekend to see her and their two kids. But Donald Trump’s betrayal doesn’t stop there. He betrayed union workers at Goodyear when he called for a boycott of buying Goodyear tires because of a personal grudge. He passed a tax bill for the super wealthy corporations that actually provided incentives for companies to move jobs overseas. Folks, manufacturing is the backbone of America. But we’re in a manufacturing recession because of Donald Trump even before the COVID virus hit. We’re down 647,000 manufacturing jobs nationwide since the crisis started, and our balance of payments, meaning we’re sending more overseas than coming to us. I mean, we’re buying more overseas than we’re selling, is higher than it’s been a long time. There’s still 10,900 lost auto worker manufacturing jobs in Ohio that did not come back. The Trump presidency will be the first presidency since Herbert Hoover over 90 years ago, first president of modern history to leave office with fewer jobs than he had when he came to office. Donald Trump’s only plan is more tax cuts for the wealthy. Most of you, if you still have a job, paid more than he paid last year in taxes. $750? Come on. The system’s rigged. We’ve got to change it. $30 billion, a new proposal, just for the gains of the 100 richest billionaires in America, 30 billion. Hear me? They made $30 billion alone in this year, while the rest of the people were getting killed. In the middle of this pandemic, why do Republicans have time to hold a hearing on the Supreme Court instead of providing the significant economic need for localities? I’ll tell you why. It’s about finally getting his wish to wipe out the Affordable Healthcare Act, because their nominee has said in the past that the law should be struck down. His relentless effort to eliminate the Affordable Care Act that provided healthcare coverage for 20 million people who didn’t have it, protections for well over 100 million people with pre-existing conditions. We’ve seen his pledge, quote, “to terminate the tax dedicated to financing Social Security.” Marcy and I were talking about that. You know what the actuary at the Social Security Department said? If it goes through, this tax, he’s talking about, cut on Social Security, it will actually bankrupt, bankrupt Social Security by the middle of 2023. Go home and tell your parents that. Not once has President Trump called for a high-level meeting between Democrats and Republicans in the White House. This is going on now. The House already passed back in the beginning of the summer this  to be able to reconcile people in real trouble, get help to states like we did. He had once called a meeting between Democrats and Republicans to deliver the new COVID relief package for working families and small businesses that are going bankrupt. He spent too much time and the bunker of his golf course or in the bunker of the White House than he was willing to actually sit to try to work something out. Check it out. First president I can ever remember, in the middle of a national economic crisis, did not try to call the parties together. He turned his back on you. I promise you I will never do that. Folks, that’s why my Build Back Better plan is built around a simple concept. It’s time to reward work, not wealth, work. I mean it. An independent analysis by a big Wall Street firm called Moody’s, not a Democratic think tank, they did an analysis of my economic plan to revive this country and an analysis of his. Here’s what they concluded: that my plan will create 18.6 million jobs in the next four years, 7 million, more than the president’s economic plan. It would generate economic growth, an additional trillion dollars more than the president’s plan. Look, what these guys don’t get is when you do well, when my family does well, everybody does better. Everybody does better. That’s the God’s truth. Here’s how my plan works. I’m not going to raise taxes on anyone who makes less than $400,000 a year. If you make more than 400, beep your horn, because you’re going to get a tax raise. Well, I’m going to raise your tax slightly if you’re making over 400. But look, you’re not going to pay a penny more. In fact, tens of millions of middle class families are going to get a tax cut when they need it most for raising their kids, trying to get affordable healthcare, buying their first home, or saving for retirement. But I’m going to ask big corporations and the super wealthy just to begin to start to pay their fair share. I’m going to raise back tax cut he gave for corporate America. They were paying the mid thirties. They’re now paying 21. If we just raise the tax back to what it should be, 28%, that generates over $100 billion. Hear me? That’s money. I mean, excuse me, $1.3 trillion. That’s what it raises to help hardworking folks, to allow us to invest in work and people and grow the middle class and make sure everybody comes along this time. My plan will create a million good-paying union jobs, manufacturing and building products and technology that we need now and in the future. We’re not investing in research. It starts with a pretty basic idea. The federal government every year spent $600 billion just making sure that we have ships and planes, cars, trains, all the things the government lets contracts for. Well, I promise you this. Every single product, every single contract let will be only let to a company or a firm that makes it in America from beginning to end. Not a joke. It’s going to be used to buy American products, support American jobs. We’ll invest to build more resilient infrastructure, roads, bridges, ports, 1.5 million new affordable housing units, high-speed broadband in every American household, more important than ever. We’re going to rebuild crumbling schools, retrofit four million buildings, and weatherize two million homes, creating one million new jobs, the reason why everyone from the electrical works and every other major union is strongly supporting us. It’s all going to be done by certified union labor. Promise. You may remember when the president put me in charge of that $800 billion, not one single contract went out that wasn’t prevailing wage, not one. So we’re going to end Trump’s new incentive for sending jobs abroad. That’s what he’s done. More jobs are going abroad now. Any company that offshores a job is going to pay a 10% penalty. Any company that brings back a job, reopens a closed factory, like a manufacturing plant, they’ll get a 10% credit for their investment. We’re going to make trade strategy that fights for every American worker and every American job and actually get results, not Trump’s chaotic trade war, erratic tweets, and bluster that’s only stiffed American workers and consumers, including farmers. He’s let you down. He’s let us down. I promise you I will stand up to China’s trade abuses, and I will invest in the American worker, because I know no one, nobody can outcompete an American worker when they’ve gotten a fair shot, nobody in the world. One more thing: The United States government owns and maintains an enormous fleet of vehicles. We’re going to convert many of them to electric vehicles, and you’re going to still need to build these transmissions for a long time to come. But any new jobs in that area are going to go to people who are in the automobile industry, who are in the manufacturing, who are in the UAW are going to be making these new vehicles, sourced right here in America. The government will provide and demand support to retool factories that are struggling to compete. The US auto industry will step up. I’ll expand capacity so the United States, not China leads the world in modern new technology. We’re going to make it easier for American consumers to move to the vehicles of the future by building a network of 500,000 charging stations across the country. We’re offering consumers rebates to swap older fuel-efficient cars. We’re going to move in a direction that technology is taking us and making sure UAW leads the way in how we do it. Together, this will mean one million good new jobs in the auto industry. Folks, it’s an example of how we can do anything. I’m more optimistic about what we have a chance to do in the next four to six years, eight years, than anything anytime in my whole career. The blinders have been taken off the American people. They see what the combination of the pandemic, the economic crisis, the racial inequality refacing, and what’s going on internationally, and they’re ready to step up. They know we have to change. Nothing, nothing, nothing is beyond the capacity of the United States of America, and I mean that. Think about it. We’re the only country in the world that’s come out of every crisis stronger than we went in because of who we are. As I’ve said to other world leaders, never underestimate the American people. There’s no quit in America. There’s none. In America, we can do anything that we need to do if we can do it together. Nothing can stop us. We have to come together. That’s why I’m running. I ran as a proud Democrat for the Senate. I had run as a proud Democrat for Vice President, and I’m running as a proud Democrat for President. But I promise you this. I will govern as an American president. I’ll govern for every one who voted for me, as well as against me. We can be better than what we’ve seen. We can be what we are at our best, the United States of America. So vote. Vote. Visit iwill.com/ohio. God bless you. God bless the auto workers. God protect. Thank you. Which way am I going? Hello, hello, hello. Good to see you all. Please, please, take a seat if you have one. Thank you so very, very much for… It’s good to be back in Florida. I want to thank my good friend Debbie Wasserman Schultz, congresswoman. She’s been a tireless fighter. Where’s Debbie? There she is. Thank you, Debbie. You’ve been a friend a long time, and thank you for all the encouragement. Toby, I also want to thank you. Toby moved from a high rent district in Brooklyn. That’s the highest rent district in America right now these days. , good to see you. I want to thank you for that kind introduction. It’s wonderful to be here with all of you to hear the stories, talk about how we’re going to get through these tough times, the difficult times. Today’s- … tough times and difficult times. Today’s story is a familiar one here in South Florida. We’re all living in some version of it right now with some of the most important parts of our lives being put on hold and the same story being lived by people like Carl Schechner, who many of you know well. Carl’s here today, I’m told. Hey Carl. How are you, man? Good to see you. The light was shining right in my eyes looking at you, man. I apologize. Carl is 39 years old. No, 93 years old, but he acts like he’s 39 years old. And the pillar of this community. So much so that a few years back, you all decided to rename this community center in his honor. I’ve heard wonderful things about you, Carl, and looking forward to saying hello to you privately. I had the pleasure of meeting Carl back in 2012. He may not remember it, but his story is what this community and this country is all about. Carl is a son of an immigrant. Carl served our nation honorably in the second World War and met his sweetheart, Anita, when they were … They’ve been married now for 67 years. Together, they built a family, four children, seven grandchildren. And more than 30 years, they made home here, staying engaged in all the local issues and holding local office, catching Sunday matinees and performances at the arts center and socializing with neighbors, enjoying nights in the town. And a couple of times, two, three times a week, going out. But their story, like so many others, is a quintessential American story these days, but it has been interrupted this year. Carl and Anita haven’t been out, I’m told, to a restaurant in seven months and there are no more Sunday matinees. Other than getting groceries, they spend most of their time in their apartment like so many people do. It’s harder than ever to spend time with the people you love, other than on Zoom or on a computer connection. We’ve all felt that sense of interruption in our lives. And we all know that this isn’t normal, that things didn’t have to be this bad. They didn’t have to be this bad. We look around at our neighbors and we know people are hurting. A lot of folks are worried about making their next rent payment, their next mortgage payment, whether or not they can purchase their prescription drugs or put food on the table. And we see an awful lot of people at the very top doing better than they’ve ever done and left to wonder an awful lot of us is, “Who’s looking out for me? Who’s looking out for me?” That’s been the entire story of my view of Donald Trump’s presidency. The fact that he’s never been focused on what matters. He’s never been focused on you. His handling of this pandemic has been erratic, just like his presidency has been. And it has prevented Florida’s seniors and people all across the country from getting the relief that they need. Donald Trump hasn’t just been willing to not do the work. I think it’s beyond that. I’m not sure he cares about delivering any real help. I think it’s both. People say he’s not willing to do the work. Well, I don’t think he cares much about it. While you’re losing precious time with your loved ones, he’s been stuck in a sand trap in one of his golf courses. And when he does decide to lift a finger, it doesn’t help you. It’s to propose new tax cuts for billionaires, and that’s not hyperbole. That’s not hyperbole. 100 wealthiest billionaires in America are expected to get another $30 billion tax cut he’s proposing. We know what happened the last time a tax cut was passed in 2017 when he came into office. Pharmaceutical companies got billions of dollars in tax breaks, and then they turned around and raised prices for medicines that you rely on to stay healthy. And they’re still doing it even during the pandemic. And quite frankly, it’s unconscionable. But Trump doesn’t really care about lowering the healthcare costs because he’s beholden to the health insurance companies and the drug companies. After all, he’s asking the United States Supreme Court as I speak, he’s asking them right now to strike down the entire Affordable Care Act, which would eliminate seniors’ ability … Most of you are on Medicare, but it would eliminate your ability in that act we passed, I was able to help put in place, was that you’d have preventative services and annual checkups and mammograms for free under Medicare. If it gets struck down, that gets wiped out as well. The rise in prescription drug prices for millions of seniors put Medicare trust fund at risk. And by the way, we used to talk about the Medicare trust fund. I say the Republicans want to eliminate it. But remember, Debbie will remember when, he’s not a bad guy in terms of his personality, but when the former Speaker of the House became Speaker, what’d they do? They proposed a half a billion dollar cut in Medicare from the start, right off the bat. These guys mean what they say. This President, as Debbie pointed out, has pledged to terminate the tax that’s dedicated to financing social security. Terminate it. A social security actuary, not Joe Biden or a liberal think tank or a newspaper. The actuary, the social security says, that would bankrupt social security in just a few years, putting those monthly checks for tens of millions of seniors that they rely on, and many of them, the only thing they rely on, at risk. All this president knows how to do is play games with people’s lives and families’ futures. Last week, he announced he was “walking away from the negotiations” that he never fully engaged in. He’s not walking away. He never fully engaged in them. To provide any additional relief for American families. Debbie, working like the devil in the house, they passed the HEROES Act. They passed two other pieces of legislation earlier to provide for the ability to keep people from going out of business, people being kicked out of their homes, et cetera. He turned his back on small businesses that are struggling to keep their doors open. He turned his back on firefighters and police officers and first responders who depend on local budgets, but local budgets are being broken and they have to be balanced. I’ll just make note here. When we inherited the largest recession, the greatest recession since the depression, what happened? President put me in charge of the Recovery Act, $800 billion. First thing I was able to do, and I was able to manage it myself, was I put $147 billion to just help state and local authorities be able to balance their budgets, not have to fire police officers, not have to fire firefighters, not to fire first responders, not have to close down health clinics. Local governments are strained to the breaking point. He turned his back on educators and school children, standing in the way of support to get them PPE and cleaning supplies and ventilation needed to reopen schools safely, which we could do if we funded it. He turned his back on every single worker whose job hasn’t come back. And now he says he wants a deal. One day he’s tweeting that the relief package is too big. The next day saying it’s too small. It’s all game. He thinks he’s still on his game show. No really. He acts that way. For real. This is a political game he’s playing. His latest gimmick, he wants to mail seniors a $200 prescription drug cash card with his name on it. So you’re going to get it before election with his name on it. But what are you going to do? He’s going to raid Medicare trust fund to pay for that $200, which seniors have already spent by paying money into. He thinks that he can take the money out of your pocket with one hand and put it back with his name stamped on it in the other hand and call it a gift. It’s dishonest. It’s reckless. And it doesn’t actually help anybody. In fact, all it will do is undermine the Medicare trust fund and increase overall out-of-pocket costs for seniors. Let’s be clear about this. Donald Trump has tried for almost four years, he says he wants to lower the drug price. Okay? But he hadn’t done a single thing to do it. In fact, the House of Representatives passed a bill that Debbie supported that would bring down prescription drug costs across the board, giving Medicare the power in Washington, Medicare department, the power to negotiate with the drug companies and say, “If an aspirin is going to cost, if we’re being charged …” I’m making this up. “If an aspirin is going to cost two cents an aspirin,” they said, “We’re only going to pay you a penny an aspirin.” They’re either going to do it or not. They’re going to have to do it. We’ve been fighting to get, Debbie and I and others, have been fighting to be able to do this for years. It would lower drug prices. What did President Trump do? He said, “If it passes, he’ll veto it.” Threatened to veto it. Folks, Donald Trump’s chaotic and divisive leadership has cost us far too much. 215,000 deaths from COVID-19 and rising. Experts say we’ll lose nearly another 200,000 lives in the next few months unless we fundamentally change courses. You know, I prayed for his recovery when he got COVID and I’d hoped at least he’d come out of it somewhat chastened. But what has he done? He’s just doubled down on the misinformation he did before and making it worse. He’s just doubled down on the misinformation he did before and making it worse. So many lives have been lost unnecessary because this President cares more about the stock market than he does about the well-being of seniors. One day before we crossed the threshold of 200,000 deaths, you may recall this, the President was at the campaign rally and insistent that the virus was, and I quote, “Affects virtually nobody, just elderly people with heart and other problems.” Nobody. Think about that. Who was he talking about when he said it infects virtually nobody? He was talking about America’s seniors. He was talking about you. He was talking about my family. You’ve worked hard your whole life contributing to society, building a family, building the country, serving America. You deserve security. You deserve respect and peace of mind, but you’re not getting it. And by the way, if this wasn’t so bizarre, if I tried to make a movie talking about something like this in America, you’d think I was making it up. Because Donald Trump, it’s simple, not a joke, you’re expendable. You’re forgettable. You’re virtually nobody. That’s how he sees seniors. That’s how he sees you. It’s no surprise this is the same man that looks at Americans who put their lives on the line like you did, sir, and many others maybe in this room, for our nation and calls them losers and suckers. I carried this card with me every day for the last 15 years. It’s my schedule. In the back of this schedule, I have a black box. It says, “Daily troop update.” The number of troops who died in Iraq and Afghanistan, 6,924. Not roughly 6,900, 924 because every one of these fallen angels that left a family behind deserves to be remembered. Everyone. US troops wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan, 53,000, as of today, 194. Everyone with only one sacred obligation, America, to care for those we send a war and equip them when they come home and take care of them and their families. And what did he say? Losers. My son volunteered to go to Iraq for a year. Before that, he had been in Kosovo for eight months. Best of my knowledge, the only foreigner who has a war monument and a major highway in that country named after him for his contribution to helping them set up their criminal justice system, then he volunteered to go to Iraq as attorney general for a year. My son was not a loser. And all of those left behind, he’s passed away, but all those left behind, they were heroes. They were patriots. I imagine that’s one of the reasons why six four-star generals and a whole lot of others have endorsed me who used to work for him because they know where his heart isn’t. That’s how he sees us. That’s the attitude he’s brought toward this whole crisis. This is the same man, you may remember, when he was told we were averaging 1000 lives lost per day, remember what he said? He said, “It is what it is.” Such concern and empathy. It is what it is. Well, it is what it is because he is who he is. That’s why it is what it is. This President, as Debbie referenced, back in January when he was being briefed by the intelligence community, he said, “I never read the briefing.” Didn’t know what was in. Didn’t have time. Well,  ego moved him to try to convince a famous journalist to write something good about him. What happened? Bob Woodward interviewed him. He acknowledged that he knew it was a dangerous and highly communicable disease, but he did nothing. He didn’t do a thing. He didn’t tell you. He didn’t tell any American. Why? He told Woodward on tape, he told Bob he didn’t want to panic the American public. Americans don’t panic. Trump panics. His reckless personal conduct since his diagnosis is unconscionable. The longer Donald Trump is the President, the more reckless he seems to get. Thank God we only have three weeks left to go. Dr. Fauci, the most respected doc in the country on these issues, referred to the President’s announcement on the Supreme Court in the Rose Garden, using the White House as a backdrop for political events. He said it was a super spreader event. And how is Trump responding? He’s running a national ad quoting Dr. Fauci out of context. Fauci had said way back in March, referring to public health officials across the nation, he said, quote, “I can’t imagine anybody could be doing more,” end of quote, meaning public health officials. But the Trump campaign, which is not unusual because I’ve had a piece of it, the trump campaign has deliberately lied. They have put Dr. Fauci in their ad asserting that Fauci was talking about Trump when he said they couldn’t have done anymore. And Fauci’s a man of integrity. After that ad came out, he said, “I did not give permission to use that quote and I wasn’t referring to the President.” Even after Fauci said that he didn’t say that about the President, the Trump ad campaign said they were going to continue to use the ad knowing it was a lie. Can any of you ever remember anything like that in a presidential campaign with a mainstream candidate? And as a consequence to months of lying and misleading and irresponsible action on the part of Donald Trump, how many empty chairs are around the dining room table tonight because of his negligence? How many people’s hearts are broken? How many people have trouble going to sleep at night because you can’t just reach over and touch? They can’t hear their son or daughter’s voice on the phone, while he throws super spreader parties at the White House where Republicans hug each other without concern to the consequences. How many of you have been unable to hug your grandkids in the last seven months? I got six of them. Two of them I just see  children, a boy and a girl live not far from me and they can walk through the woods. The only way I can see them, I stand in the back porch and they stand down and I bribe them with Haagen-Dazs bars. But every single day I contact them. But I can’t hug them. I can’t embrace it. And I’m luckier than most because they’re nearby, those two of those six. My grandkids, your grandkids, we hope will grow up to treat one another with kindness, respect and empathy, qualities the President has never, ever shown. It’s become painfully clear as his careless arrogant, reckless COVID response has caused one of the worst tragedies in American history. The only senior that Donald Trump cares about, the only senior is the senior Donald Trump  seem to do anything for. And by the way, minority communities are getting particularly hit by this. You realize as of about a month ago, on a percentage basis, 1 in 1000 African Americans in all of American have died. And the estimate is, by the end of this year, 1 in 500 African Americans in America will die. 1 in 500. If he doesn’t do something quickly and we hit 400,000, that is more people, the same number of people that died in the war you fought of all four years. 400,000 dead in War War II, in less than a year if he doesn’t move. The only one Donald Trump would do anything for is Donald Trump. Look, folks, you all know we’re so much better than this. We- We’re so much better than this. We can contain this virus. We can fully reopen our economy. We can bring Congress together to pass real relief, and then implement a comprehensive agenda to build back better. My economic proposal … And by the way, it’s not a liberal think tank or a Democratic think tank that says this. An independent analysis put out by Moody’s, a Wall Street firm, projects that my economic plan will create 18.6 million good paying jobs between now and the end of the first term. Seven million more jobs than the President’s plan. And create a trillion more dollars in economic growth than the President’s plan. It’s solid. It’s real. Here’s how my plan works. I’m not going to raise taxes on a single solitary American making less than $400,000 a year. You won’t pay a penny more. It’s a guarantee. But I’m going to ask big corporations and the wealthy to begin to pay their fair share to straighten out the tax structure. That money will allow us to invest in working people. I carry it with me … I don’t know if I have it with me now, I don’t … a card that lists all of what is in the tax code. We went ahead, the President’s tax plan, Barack and I were suggesting we reduce corporate tax from 35% to 28. That was the consensus. He reduced it to 21%. You know how much that costs? $1.3 trillion. We just take it back up to 28, and we’ll generate $1.3 trillion more. 91 of the Fortune 500 companies don’t pay a penny in tax. Not a single solitary cent. If we made sure there was a minimum tax at 15%, that would add another $400 billion. We’re going to take this money and we’re going to invest in a working people, in a growing middle class and make sure everyone is included in the deal. I want tax reform in the tax code because we’re spending your tax dollars on the wrong things. As I said, Donald Trump cut the tax from 35 to 21 costing the treasury a fortune. As I said, if we raised it back to 28%, $1.3 trillion would be coming to the treasury over the next decade, instead of giving big corporations hundreds of billions to pay for buying back their own stock, moving jobs overseas. We should invest it in cures for cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. That’s why I proposed giving the National Institute of Health $50 billion over the next four years to go after cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. If we do not, and no drug company has the capacity to do it, if we do not find an answer to Alzheimer’s, then the next 19 years, every single solitary bed that exists in the United States of America now will be occupied by an Alzheimer’s patient. Look, my dad used to have an expression. He said, “Joey, if everything’s equally important to you, nothing’s important to you. You have to have priorities.” What are our priorities? Our priorities is to make sure that everybody in America has an equal shot. This is about you. It’s about what’s fair. It’s about what our priorities should be, and we can deal with the scourge of cancer and these other diseases when Donald Trump has no interest. In fact, he wants to do the opposite. He proposes more tax cuts for the super wealthy. Like Donald Trump, we’re going to ease the burden on major costs in your life, unlike him. Including the financial burden of caregiving so many families are now carrying. Right now, as you probably know, and you have friends, 800,000 Americans are eligible for home community care through Medicaid, signed up for it, have been waiting an average of five years. They’re waiting for a phone call back. For some, five years. My plan makes a bold investment so the states can clear the waiting list and also take the pharmaceutical companies. Will allow Medicaid to, again, use its enormous bargaining power to negotiate prices and bring the costs down for everyone, not just seniors. Give all Americans access to those lower prices. And what he also hates my doing and so do the drug companies, we’re going to establish a board like it is in other countries of outside experts to set limits on the prices of new specialty drugs that are life-saving drugs that costs an arm and leg, figuratively and literally, that have no competition. This board is going to set up and say, “This is how much you can charge based on what you’ve invested. You make a healthy profit, but you will not be able to raise the price of the drug without proof that you’ve taken other action that you have required you to improve the drug.” So it can only be raised with the cost of medical inflation. Independent analysis found that my plan will slash the cost of prescription drugs by 60%. How many of you know somebody who’s had to sell things just to get the drugs that have gone up exponentially? We’re going to protect Social Security and increase benefits for millions of seniors. I’ll fight to protect your pensions, including fixing older employer pensions, so many Floridians earned and deserve. Folks, I guess we’ll see them with this. I’m confident. I know as bad as things are we say, “Oh my God, how can it get better?” I am absolutely confident we can do this and more. We just have to come together. I’m running as a proud Democrat. I’m going to govern as an American president. I’m going to work as hard for those who voted against me as those who voted for me. That’s the job of a president. A duty to care. To care for everyone. And after all we’ve been through, all America’s accomplished, all the years that we’ve stood as a beacon to the world, we cannot let ourselves remain divided, but we have to vote. Go to, Iwillvote.com/fl. You can still request your vote by mail ballot. The deadline’s October 24. Request your ballot. If you have it already mail it or drop it in one of the drop boxes today. Look, I’m tired of us all walking around with our heads down, as if there’s nothing we can do. This is the United States of America. There’s not a single thing beyond our capacity, nothing we’ve ever decided to do we’ve not accomplished, when we done it together. Remember when we were kids, you had to learn about famous speech John Kennedy made about going to the moon. Everybody remembers the different pieces of it. The part I remember, my college used to kid me in the Senate when I was there. When answering the unasked question, “Why was he doing it?” He said, “Because we refuse to postpone.” We refuse to postpone one more day, which is within our capacity as Americans to do. There’s nothing beyond our capacity. There’s no limit to our future. We’ve got to stand up, lift our heads up. The only thing that can tear America part is America itself. And he’s well on the way trying to do that. Everybody knows who Donald Trump is. That’s within who we are. Who we are. We choose hope over fear. Unity, over division. Science over fiction. And yes, truth over lies. We can do this folks. I promise you. But you got to vote. May god bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you for listening. You’re a very patient audience. Thank you, thank you. Appreciate it. Good to be with you. Okay. I know it well. Well, first of all, going back, the fact is that the president was informed how dangerous this virus was. And all the way back in the beginning of February, I argued that we should be keeping people in China. And we had set up, in our administration, a pandemic office within the White House. There were 44 people on the ground. I suggested that we should be seeking, and I didn’t hold public office, I was a former Vice President, we in fact asked to have access to the source of the problem. And the best of our knowledge, Trump never pushed that. All those 44 people came home, never got replaced. In addition to that, I pointed out that I thought in February, I did a piece for USA Today saying, “This is a serious problem. Trump denied it. He said it wasn’t.” We later learned that he knew full well how serious it was when he did an interview with George Woodward. I mean, excuse me, Bob Woodward. And at the time, he said he didn’t tell anybody because he was afraid Americans would panic. Americans don’t panic, he panicked. He didn’t say a word to anybody. Then I wrote a piece in March about what I thought we should be doing to take hold of this, using the… There’s an act that passed a long time ago that allows the president to go into a business and say, “Stop making this, and start making that.” And it took a long time for him to even institute that, to get ventilators and so on. And so, the point was he missed enormous opportunities and kept saying things that weren’t true. It’s going to go away by Easter, don’t worry about it. When the summer comes, it’s all going to go away like a miracle. He’s still saying those things. Not back then. Not in January, February. No, that’s correct, there wasn’t. That came at the end of March. And then I laid out a detailed plan relative to school openings in June and July. By that time, the science was becoming clearer and clearer of how this was spreading so rapidly. But the president kept denying that. If you notice, from March on, I stopped doing big meetings, I started wearing masks. So, it was at a time when the science was saying, and his key people, Dr. Fauci were saying, “You should be taking these precautions.” So, what we should be doing now, there should be a national standard. Instead of leaving this up to, remember what the president said to the governors, “Well, they’re on their own, it’s not my responsibility. The governors can do what they need to do, not my responsibility.” It is a presidential responsibility to lead, and he didn’t do that. He didn’t talk about what needed to be done because he kept worrying, in my view, about the stock market. He worried if he talked about how bad this could be, unless we took these precautionary actions, then in fact, the market would go down. And his barometer of success to the economy is the market. Thirdly, what we didn’t do is, the president had an opportunity to open and allow schools and businesses to stay open if they got the kind of help they needed. So, the Congress passed a couple of trillion dollars worth of help. And what happened was most of that money, a significant portion of that money went to the very wealthiest corporations in the country, didn’t get to the mom and pop stores. So, you had one in five, one in six minority businesses closing. Many of them permanently. People being laid off. And then what happened was, when the first round of money for unemployment, enhanced unemployment went by, he didn’t do anything. He didn’t do anything. And to the best of my knowledge, and I mean this sincerely, I can’t think of, I’ve been around for a lot of presidents, and you know a lot of presidents in a crisis, I don’t ever remember one never calling the House and Senate Republicans, Democrats together. By the way, in the context, would I lock down the economy if science said so? I said I’d follow science. But I don’t think there’s a need to lock down. Get there. Well, you can contain the pandemic by being rational and not crush economy. For example, I laid out a plan, how you can open businesses. You can open businesses and schools, if in fact you provide them the guidance that they need, as well as the money to be able to do it. What’s happening now is, we know, for example, if you can open a business and you could have a sign on the door saying, “Safe to come in.” And that’s why people aren’t going anyway, when they’re open. And say, because you have social distancing, you have plastic barriers, when you go to the cashier, you have separators between the booths. You don’t have large crowds, you reduce the size, the number of people you can have in the restaurant. You make sure there’s testing, that’s a really critical piece that he didn’t do testing and tracing. And you make sure that people are equipped, going to schools. You know, we initially said, the government initially said, they’re going to provide masks for every student and every teacher. Then they said, “No, no, no, no.” FEMA said, the president or whomever said, ‘No, no, no. That’s not a national emergency, not a national emergency.” We need more teachers in our schools to be able to open smaller pods. We need ventilation systems change. There’s a lot of things we know now, and I laid them out in some detail. Now again, when I say I laid them out, I’m not an office holder. I’m running for office. It’s not like I’m still Vice President, or I wasn’t a United States Senator pushing this. So, I don’t want to say, “I, I, I.” But we did lay out exactly what needed to be done. And take a look, we make up 4% of the world’s population. We have 20% of the world’s deaths. We’re in a situation where we have 210 plus thousand people dead. And what’s he doing? Nothing. He’s still not wearing masks, and so on. Sure. Thank you. Hey, Kelly. How are you? Yes. Two things. Number one, President Trump talks about things that just aren’t accurate, about everything from vaccines, we’re going to have one right away, is it going to happen, and so on. The point is that, if the scientists, if the body of scientists say that this is what is ready to be done, and it’s been tested, they’ve gone through the three phases. Yes, I would take it. I’d encourage people to take it. But President Trump says things like, everything from this crazy stuff he’s walking away from now, inject bleach in your arm, and that’s going to work. I’m not being facetious, he’s actually said these things. And now, Regeneron is the answer. That’s going to cure everything. There’s 500,000 doses, we have more than a few million people, you know? And so, if you noticed, most of the companies who are developing these vaccines are working, they’re making real progress. I meet with four leading scientists, at least twice a week. In the beginning, four times a week, giving us the detail on what kind of progress is being made. And right now, they do the right thing. When they run into a serious problem, they halt the test. They don’t continue until they figure out what the problem was. They’re not there yet. And the most scientists say, that it’s not likely to have a vaccine that would be available until the beginning of next year, into the spring of next year. And in the meantime, what I worry about is the same thing with Regeneron, which is a useful antidote. Not antidote, a useful tool. But what’s happening is there was no plan to figure out how to distribute it. We have 500,000 vials of it. Well, we don’t have all the testing equipment. We don’t have all the ability to get it to the people who need it. And what we should be doing now, and allegedly it’s happening, but I’ve not seen it yet nor the docs that I’ve talked to seen it. There should be a plan when we have the vaccine, how do we distribute it? The answer is, depending on how clear… Vaccines, they say, have a very positive impact and that you’re going to affect positively 85% of the American public. Or there’s others say, “This vaccine is really the key. This is the golden key.” It depends on the state of the nature of the vaccine when it comes out, and how it’s being distributed. But I would think that we should be talking about, depending on the continuation of the spread of the virus, we should be thinking about making it mandatory. Well, you couldn’t, that’s the problem. Just like you can’t enforce measles, you can’t come to school unless you have a measles shot. You know, you can’t. But you can’t say, everyone has to do this, just like you can’t mandate a mask. But you can say, you can go to every governor and get them all in a room, all 50 of them as president and say, ” Ask people to wear the mask. Everybody knows.” And if they don’t, no. Not fine. Then I go to every governor, I go to every mayor, I go to every councilmen, and I go to every local official, say, “Mandate the mask.” Say, “This is what you have to do when you’re out. Make sure you encourage it being done.” Look, George, you and I know, and I think you do too as well, the words of a president matter. No matter whether they’re good, bad, or indifferent, they matter. And when a president doesn’t wear a mask or makes fun of folks like me, when I was wearing a mask for a long time, then people say, “Well, it mustn’t be that important.” But when a president says, “I think this is very important.” For example, I walked in here with this mask, but I have one of the N95 masks underneath it. I left it in my dressing room. Not the dresser, the room I was in before I got here. And so, I think it matters what we say. And we’re now learning that children are getting the virus, not with as serious consequences, but there’s been no studies done yet on vaccines for children. So, there’s a long way to go, but we can make progress in the meantime and save lives. And the last point I’ll make, if you listen to the head of the CDC, he stood up and he said, “You know, while we’re waiting for a vaccine.” He held up a mask. “You wear this mask, you’ll save more lives between now and the end of the year than if we had a vaccine.” It’s estimated by every major study done from the University of Washington to Columbia, that if in fact we wore masks, we could save, between now and the end of the year, a hundred thousand lives. And avoid lockdown, yes. You don’t have to lock down if you’re wearing the mask. Thank you, I hope I answered your question. I know it. That’s right. I carry this card with me. When I said the Trump tax cuts, about 1.3 trillion of the $2 trillion in his tax cuts went to the top one 10th of 1%. That’s what I’m talking about eliminating, not all the tax cuts that are out there. And by the way, if you take a look, we reduced the corporate tax rate from 35%. and Democrats, Republicans who were in office thought it should come down to 28%. He reduced it to 21%. You have 91 out of the Fortune 500 companies not paying a single solitary penny. If you raise the corporate tax back to 28%, which is a fair tax, you’d raise one trillion, three hundred billion dollars by that one act. If you made sure that people making over 400 grand paid what they did in the Bush administration, 39.6%, you would raise another, it goes up to let me get you the exact number here, about another 200, excuse me. $92 billion. So, you could raise a lot of money to be able to invest in things that can make your life easier. Make you change your standard of living by making sure you have affordable health care, by making sure you’re in a situation where you’re able to send your kid to school. If you have student debt, you can deal with it. Making sure that your home, you can pay your mortgage. You got 20 million people, right now. Sure. Absolutely. That’s a great question. Moody’s did analysis of my detailed analysis of my tax plan and my economic plan. They said, I will, in four years, Moody’s Wall Street, said I will create 18.6 million new jobs, good paying jobs, number one. Number two, the GDP will grow by a trillion dollars more than would under Trump, and 7 million more jobs than under Trump. And the reason is, when you allow people to get back in the game and have a job, everything moves. Everything moves. Right now, you got the opposite. You had, last year during this pandemic, you had the wealthiest billionaires in the world, in the nation, they made another $700 billion. $700 billion. He talks about a V-shape recovery. It’s a K shape recovery. If you’re on the top, you’re going to do very well. And if you’re in the bottom, or you’re in the middle or the bottom, your income is coming down. You’re not getting a raise. I shouldn’t, I don’t know what you do. You may get a raise. Hope you’re a billionaire. But all kidding aside, it’s about growing the economy. And George, the way out, the reason why I’m so optimistic about economic recovery, more than I’ve ever been, is we have these four crises happening all at once. And one helps the other. For example, we’re going to invest a great deal of that money into infrastructure, and to a green infrastructure. We’re going to put 500,000 charging stations on new highways we’re building, and all highways we’re building. We’re going to own the electric market. You know as well as I do from your days, you know, in the old days, where the president spends about $600 billion a year on government contracts. Everything from making sure they have aircraft carriers, to automobile fleets in the United States. If you make, and it’s not in violation of any international trade agreement, made in America. If you actually insist that whatever that product is, made in America, including the material that goes into the product. It is estimated we’re going to create somewhere between another four and six million jobs just by doing that. But what’s happening now under his trade policy, a lot of this is going overseas. You get a benefit from going overseas, if you have much of it being made overseas. So, if you send it overseas, you get a 10% tax increase on a product. If you make it in America and you bring it back, you get a 10% growth. If you bring back a company, and you’re going to open up an old facility, you get a 10% tax credit for all you invested. That actually works, George. No, well. I got to get the votes. I got to get the votes. That’s why, the one thing, I have this strange notion. We are a democracy. Some of my Republican friends and some of my Democratic friends, even occasionally say, “Well, if you can’t get the votes by executive order, you’re going to do something. Things you can’t do by executive order, unless you’re a dictator.” We’re democracy, we need consensus. I hope I answered your question. Don’t jump, Cedric. You’re look like you’re way up there. Good evening. Well, I’d say first of all, as my buddy John Lewis said, “It’s a sacred opportunity, the right to vote. You can make a difference.” If young Black women and men vote, you can determine the outcome of this election. Not a joke. You can do that. Then the next question is, am I worthy of your vote? Can I earn your vote? And the answer is, there’s two things I think that I care and I’ve demonstrated I care about my whole career. One is, in addition to dealing with a criminal justice system to make it fairer and make it more decent, we have to be able to put Black Americans in a position to be able to gain wealth, generate wealth. And so you look at what that entails. It entails everything from early education, that’s why I’m supporting making sure that Title One schools, as you know, schools with the least tax base to be able to support their schools, I increased the funding from them from $15 to $45 billion. That allows every teacher in that school to make up to 60,000 bucks, and the problem now is they’re leaving the schools. They’re not there. We’re short about a million and a half teachers, a million and a quarter teachers. Number two, every three and four and five-year-old will go to school, school, not daycare, school, and with all the great universities, including the one you’ve gone to, go to, or went to, in fact, talks about in the last eight years, what’s happened. What happens when you let them go to school? They make up rapidly whatever shortcoming they had in terms of their education prior to that. They have not heard as many words spoken, et cetera, et cetera. What happens is that, the studies show, that 58% will increase by 58% their chance of going all through 12 years of school, and going through successfully. It will also provide for the ability to bring in social workers and school psychologists. We have one school psychologist in America now for every 1,507 kids. It should be one to 500, not just in schools that are poor, but in all schools, because we learned that, for example, drug abuse doesn’t cause mental illness, mental illness causes drug abuse, the failure to get hold of people and deal with their anxieties. In addition to that, I provide for a $70 billion for HBC use for them to be able to have the wherewithal to do what other universities can do, because they don’t have the kind of foundational support they need. And so that would allow them, for example, like we did in our administration, the President allowed me to go down and we awarded a cybersecurity laboratory, ability to compete for cybersecurity laboratory. The federal government spends billions of dollars a year on universities, because there are the best kept secret and where most of the major inventions come out of. And so that school now will be able to produce young Black women and men who are going to go into a field of the future that’s burgeoning, cybersecurity. And that’s what is going to help a great deal. In addition to that, if you’re a young man about to graduate and you graduated from school and you want to own your first home, well, it’s awful hard to get the money, depending on the background, where your economic background is, to get a down payments. So we’re going to guarantee first term home buyers a $15,000 down payment for first term home buyers. In addition to that, all the studies now show, and I’ve been arguing this for a long time, is young Black entrepreneurs are just as successful as White entrepreneurs or anyone else given a shot. But you can’t get the money. Where do you go to get the startup money? So what President Obama and I did, we had a program where we took $1.5 billion and we invested it in all the SBAs around the country, and the state SBAs, small business associations, and that generated $30 billion came off the sideline. Because if you have a guarantee of $200,000 for your new startup enterprise, a young entrepreneur, you’re going to be able to attract, if it’s government money and it’s a guarantee, you could be able to attract another $100,000. It generated $30 billion. Well, I’m changing that program and I’ll get this done without much trouble I believe in the Congress from $1.5 million to $30 billion. That’ll take $300 billion off the sideline and grow. And, for example, if you, in fact, and I were the same age and we split our differences, if we were the same age, and we went to the same builder to buy us each the same home, but my home was in a White neighborhood on one side of a highway, and yours is in a Black neighborhood, same exact home, your home will start off being valued 29% less than my home. Yet your insurance for that home will be higher. You’ll be taxed more for it. We’ve got to end this. That’s what got me involved in politics in the first place, a thing called red lining. We can change so much that we can do so much to change the circumstances to give people a real opportunity. Well, there’s a lot more if you’re going to hang around afterwards. I’ll tell you more. No, but I really mean it. It’s the key. Look, this is the way every other … Like my dad, he lost his job up in Scranton and it took him three years to be able to move down to Delaware, to Claymont, Delaware, a little steel town, and send us home to our grandpop to live with him. We finally got back. We lived in an apartment, which became six and eight housing much later. It was just normal apartments. But it took him five years to be able to buy a home. Well, we bought a three bedroom home with four kids and a grandpop living with us, but it accumulated wealth. You built up wealth. That’s how middle-class folks make it. They build up wealth. Then he was able to borrow a little against that to be able to help us get the school, those kinds of things. It’s about accumulating wealth and you’re behind an eight ball. The vast majority of people of color are behind an eight ball. And it’s the same way what’s going on now with all this money that’s been voted. What’s happened? You go to the bank, if you’re a Black businessman, and the President fired the only Inspector General to see oversee all this help coming from the Congress. And what happens? You go in and they say, “Ah, do you have an account here?” “No.” “Do you have a credit card?” “No.” “Have you borrowed from us before ?” “No.” We bailed these suckers out. They’re not liable for any of the money, but they still won’t lend it to you. We’ve got to change that. It’s about accumulating wealth. I’m sorry. Well, first of all, things have changed drastically. That Crime Bill, when it voted, the Black Caucus voted for it. Every Black mayor supported it across the board and the Crime Bill itself did not have mandatory sentences except for two things. It had three strikes and you’re out, which I voted against, in the Crime Bill, but it had a lot of other things in it that turned out to be both bad and good. I wrote the Violence Against Women Act. That was part of the assault weapons ban and other things that were good. What I was against was giving states more money for prison systems that they could build, state prison systems. And you have 93 out of every 100 people in jail now is in a state prison, not in a federal prison, because they built more prisons. I also wrote into that bill a thing called drug courts. I don’t believe anybody should be going to jail for drug use. They should be going into mandatory rehabilitation. We should be building rehab centers to have these people housed. We should decriminalize marijuana, wipe out the record so you can actually say honesty, “You ever been arrested for murder for anything?” You can say no, because we’re going to pass a law saying there is no background that you have to reveal relative to the use of marijuana. And so there’s a lot of things. But in addition to that, we’ve got to change the system. I joined with a group of people in the House to provide for changing the system from punishment to rehabilitation. Along with a guy named Marlon Specter, who you may remember, I wrote the Second Chance Act. Right. Yes, it was. But here’s where the mistake. The mistake came in terms of what the states did locally. What we did federally, we said, you remember, George, it was all about the same time for the same crime. What I had done as the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I took the 10 Circuit Courts of Appeals, took some really brilliant lawyers working for me in Judiciary, we did a study and we determined what happens if, for the first, second, third offense for any crime in the criminal justice system at the federal level, if you’re a Black man and it’s the first time you’ve committed robbery, how long would you go to jail? On average? If you’re White man, how long? The Black man would go to jail on average 13 years. White man, two years. I’d go down the list of every single crime. So we set up a sentencing commission. We didn’t set the time. Every single solitary maximum was reduced in there. But what happened was it became the same time for the same crime. So it said, “You have to serve between one and three years.” And it ended up becoming much lower, Black folks went to jail a lot less than they would have before. But it was a mistake. Yes, if in fact they’re involved in community policing, not jump squads. For example, when we had community policing, from the mid-’90s on until till Bush got elected, what happened? Violent crime actually went down precipitous. Remember the significant rise in violent crime that was occurring in the late ’80s into the ’90s. It went down and fewer African Americans were arrested because you had the requirement. The cops didn’t like it. They didn’t like the community policing, because you had to have two people in the vehicle, they had to get out of their cars, they had to introduce themselves to who own the local liquor store, who owned the local grocery store, who was the woman on the corner. And what they would do, George, they’d actually go and give people their phone numbers. A cop would give the phone number. So if Nelly Smith was on the second floor where drug deals took place and things happened below her apartment, she could call and say, “It’s Millie, and there’s something going on here.” And they’d never revealed it was her, because they’d know, if she knew that, in fact, they report, they’d never report the crime, she’d never report. So it actually started to come down. And what happened? They eliminated the funding for community policing. Community policing doesn’t mean more people coming in, in armored Humvees and swarming. It turned out that by the time we got to the late ’90s and crime had come down so much, the mayors and everybody asked the question, “Where do you want me to spend the money?” They say, “Well, only 1% thought violent crime was a problem.” It was as high as 22%. You have to change the way in which they . One of the things I’m going to do, George, is what is set up a national study group made up of cops, social workers, as well as made up of the Black community and the Brown community to sit down in the White House and over the next year come up with significant reforms that need to take place within communities. You have to bring them together. One of the things I’ve observed is, the neighborhood I grew up, I grew up in Claymont, you either became a cop, a firefighter, or a priest. I wasn’t qualified much to do any one of them, but here’s the deal, all kidding aside. Most cops don’t like bad cops. They don’t like it. And so what happens is they get intimidated into not reporting. So one of the things we do is there has to be transparency available. We have to be able to go in at the federal level, be able to go in and check out whether or not there’s systematic problems within police departments. If, in fact, a cop needs to be tried, it’s not the prosecutor in the community, in the district there. You’ve got to go outside the community to get another prosecutor to come in to handle the crime. There’s a lot of things we’ve learned, and it takes time but we can do this. You can ban choke holds, but beyond that, you have to teach people how to de-escalate circumstances. De-escalate. So instead of anybody coming at you and the first thing you do is shoot to kill, you shoot them in the leg. There’s ways you have to do more background checks in terms of whether or not the person coming in, passes a certain psychological test. And the last thing I’ll say, and I’m sorry, but it’s really, I think, really, really important, is you have to be in a position where you are able to identify, identify the things that have to change. And one of the things that has to change is so many cops get called into circumstances where somebody is mentally off. Like what happened not long ago, that guy with the knife. That’s why we have to provide within police departments psychologists and social workers to go out with the cops on those calls, some of those 911 calls to de-escalate the circumstance, to deal with talking them down. But cops are kind of like school teachers now. A school teacher has to know everything from how to handle hunger in a household as well as how to teach how to read. Well, cops or don’t have that breadth, and there’s a lot of things we can do. We shouldn’t be defunding cops. We should be mandating the things that we should be doing within police departments and make sure there’s total transparency. I don’t know the answer to your question. Hey, Nathan. Well, let me start at the last point and work my way back. I think there’s great reason to be concerned. I was on the road most of the time during these hearings so I didn’t hear many of them. I just got the recaps when I’d get in late at night. I’m been going around the country, Florida, anyway, but my reading online what the judge said was she didn’t answer very many questions at all. And I don’t even think she is laid out much of a judicial philosophy in terms of the basis upon which she thinks  in the Constitution, nonetheless. So, number one. So I think there’s great reason to be concerned for the LGBT community, something I fought very hard for, for a long time to make sure there’s equality across the board. Number two, I think that also healthcare overall is very much in jeopardy as a consequence of the President’s going to go directly after this election directly to the Supreme Court within a month to try to get Obamacare wiped out after 10 million people have already lost her insurance from their employer and wants to take 20 million people out of the system as well, plus 100 million people with pre-existing conditions. So there’s a lot at stake. I don’t think it’s appropriate. I think the Constitution implies, there’s no provision in the Constitution, my problem is I made a mistake of teaching constitutional law for 21 years, and the separation of powers, the Constitution implies that their way the people have a right to determine who’s going to be on the court is how they vote for their Senators and their President. We seek the advice and consent of the Senate. And the President- He is. But once an election begins, by implication, it is inconsistent with the constitutional principles, in my view. You get disagreement among scholars on this, but I believe it’s inconsistent when millions of people have already voted to put someone on the Court. I think it should have been held until this election is over, see what the makeup of the Senate is going to be. If the President wins this election, he should be able to go for it. What I wanted to do, George, you know if I had answered the question directly then all the focus would be on, what’s Biden going to do if he wins? Instead of on, is it appropriate what is going on now? And it should stay. This is the thing that the President loves to do, always take our eye off the ball what’s at stake. One of the things Pete has suggested is, and there’s a number of constitutional scholars have suggested as well, that there are at least four or five options that are available to determine whether or not you can change the way in which the court lifetime appointment takes place consistent arguably with the Constitution. I have not been a fan of court packing because then it just generates what will happen. Whoever wins, it just keeps moving in a way that is inconsistent with what is going to be manageable. Well, I’m not a fan. It depends on how this turns out. Not how he wins, but how it’s handled, how it’s handled. But there’s a number of things that are going to be coming up and there’s going to be a lot of discussion about other alternative as well. For example, there’s actually real live debate on the floor, if people are really going to be able to have a time to go through this. I don’t know anybody who’s gone on the floor that’s been a controversial justice in terms of making fundamentally or altering the makeup of the court that’s gone through in a day kind of thing. I mean, it depends on … … and the makeup of the court has gone through in a day kind of thing. I mean, it depends on how much they rushed this. And you think about it, George, here you got a lot of people not to be able to pay their mortgage, not being able to put food on the table, not being able to keep their business open, not being able to do anything to deal with what’s going on in terms of the economy as a consequence of COVID and they have no time to deal with that, but they have time to rush this through. I’m open to considering what happens from that point on. It is. Good choice. No matter what answer I gave you, if I say it, that’s the headline tomorrow. It won’t be about what’s going on now, the improper way they’re proceeding. They do have a right to know what I stand and they’ll have a right to know where I stand before they vote. Yes. Depending on how they handle this. But look, what you should do is you got to make sure you vote and vote for a senator who in fact reflects your general view on constitutional interpretation, and vote for a president who thinks is more in line with you. And if you oppose the position that I would not have appointed her, but if you oppose my position, vote for Trump, vote for Republican who shares that view, but that’s your opportunity to get involved in lifetime appointments that have presidents come and go, justices stay and stay and stay. John’s writing in for me, by the way. I’m sorry. Oh yeah, I’ll be darned. It was written by a fellow who won the Pulitzer prize for a book he wrote about the presidency. He said I doubt whether Biden is really Irish. He doesn’t hold a grudge. In politics, grudges don’t work. They make no sense. I really mean it. I have never, and the second point I’d make is everybody talks about, “Yeah, Joe, when you were a senator and a chairman of foreign relations or chairman of judiciary, you got a lot of things done. You’re able to cross the aisle but the days are changed. When you’re vice president, you got a lot done, but it can’t happen anymore.” It can. We got to change the nature of the way we deal with one another. And it starts off by the way your father was and Tip was and others. You don’t question another man or woman’s motive. You can question their judgment, but not their motive. We badly needed an infrastructure bill. Well, what happens? I stand up and I say, “We need an infrastructure bill, Senator, but I tell you what, you’re in the pocket of the cement industry, but let’s see what we can do.” He can’t get anywhere. Nothing happens. Nothing happens. I learned that lesson a long time ago. I’ve never, even when it’s obvious on its face what the motive is, stick to the subject and listen to the other guy. Listen, what I will be doing as, if I’m elected president and the first thing and not a joke. And you can ask if they’d tell you, your dad’s old friends in the Republican side, I’m going to pick up the phone and call them and say, “Let’s get together. We’ve got to figure out how we’re going to move forward here.” Because there’s so many things we really do agree on. And with Trump out of the way, the vindictiveness of a president going after Republicans who don’t do exactly what he says gets taken away. There’s going to be, I promise you, between four and eight Republican senators who are going to be willing to move on things where there’s bipartisan consensus. Last example I’ll give you. After Trump had been elected, named the next president, wasn’t sworn in yet, I’ve been working on a thing called a bill relating to cancer cures. Okay? And it was called the Cancer Moonshot. And I work with a number of Democrats and Republicans. And we had a bill that was about $9 billion that made significant increases in research and development on cancer alternatives, NIH and particularly specific cancer initiatives. And we only had at the time I think it was 111 or 114, whatever it was, votes in the house. I don’t hold any exact number. And we had fewer than 40 in the Senate, but after he was elected, I got those people together as vice president and we sat down and we worked it out and we ended up getting a pass 396 votes in the house and 94 votes in the Senate. And at the end of the day, because it had to do with the Biden Cancer Moonshot I’ve been working on, Mitch McConnell. Mitch McConnell stood up and I was presiding officer and moved to name the bill after my deceased son, Beau, who had just died. So, there are ways to bring this together. What the Biden Justice Department will do is let the Department of Justice be the Department of Justice. Let them make the judgments of who should be prosecuted. They’re not my lawyers. They’re not my personal lawyer. I’m not going to rule in or out. Well, I’m going to hire really first rate prosecutors and people who understand the law like Democrat and Republican administrations have had, and let them make the judgements, but turning this into a vehicle for your, as if it’s your own law firm, you don’t own that justice department. You pick the best people you can and you hope that what they’re going to do is they’re going to enforce the law as they see it. But can you remember any Republican president going out there or former Democratic president go find that guy and prosecute him? Remember, where you hear that? Or by the way, I’m being sued because a woman has accused me of rape. Represent me. Represent me. Personally represent me in the state of New York on my not allowing my tax returns. What’s that all about? What is that about? Hello. Well, first of all, I make it clear. I do not propose banning fracking. I think you have to make sure that fracking is in fact not emitting methane or polluting the well or dealing with what can be small earthquakes in how they’re drilling. So, it has to be managed very, very well, number one. Number two, what we have to do is the future rests in renewable energy. The single fastest growing energy source in the world right now, because I’m going to say something that’s going to sound self-serving, but I manage the RecoveryAact and I was able to invest billions of dollars into bringing down the cost per BTU of wind and solar. So now it’s cheaper than coal, is cheaper than oil right now, and it has great, great promise. And it’s also the fastest growing employer in the energy industry. And so there are a number of things that I would do immediately. Number one, there are well over 100,000 wells that are left uncapped in the region. We could hire 128,000 of these people who are working in the industry to cap these wells and get a good salary doing it now, number one. Number two, we should be moving toward finding the new technologies that are going to be able to deal with carbon capture. So, ultimately, it’s a transition we moved from, to a net zero emission of carbon that we’re still going to be able to use if we find the right technology, some gases, some gas to be able to, if we can carbon capture. And I think we’re going to be able to move in a direction where by the year 2035, we’ll be able to have net zero emissions of carbon from the creation of energy, energy creation so we can move it by dealing with those. And every time we talk about global warming or the environment, the president thinks it’s a joke and I think as jobs, because what we’re going to have happened is you’ll be able to see now, as I started to say before. I as president is going to invest that $600 billion that we spend in government contracts, only on those things that in fact also are not only made in America, but building an infrastructure that’s clean and new. And what we have to do is focus on the transmission of energy across the country from areas relating to solar and wind. The reason is that they have not, that has not been mastered yet. I met a lot of people in Silicon Valley. The battery technology is increasing significantly so you’re going to be able to have, for example, solar on your home and a battery the, this by this by this, as I’m showing you here in your basement. So when the sun doesn’t shine for five days, you still have enough energy. So, we’re making significant progress. The other thing we’re going to do is provide an awful lot of work. It’s estimated to put close to a million people to work by weatherizing four million buildings and two million homes, because we’ll save tons and tons of energy or billions of barrels of energy over time. And at the same time provide significant employment and a good union wages, prevailing wages. Boilermaker’s overwhelming endorsement. Okay? So, the Boilermakers Union has endorsed me because I sat down with them and went in a great detail with leadership exactly what I would do, number one. Number two, what I would do is I would giving tax breaks and subsidizing oil. We don’t need to subsidize oil any longer, number one. We should stop that and save billions of dollars over time. What I would also do with regard to there’s no, the difference between me and the new green deal, they say automatically by 2030 we’re going to be carbon free. Not possible. My deal is a crucial framework, but not the new green deal. The new green deal calls for elimination of all non renewable energy by 2030. You can’t get there. You’re going to need to be able to transition, George, to be able to transition to get to the place where we invest in new technologies that allow us to do things that get us to a place where we get to net zero emission, including in agriculture. I’ve laid out a detailed plan. We should be taking the plan where we allow significant more land to be put in conservation, plant deep rooted plants which absorb carbon from the air and in fact, pay farmers to do it. We can do things like pelletize all the chicken manure and all the horse manure and cow manure, and take out the methane and use it as fertilizer and make a lot of money doing it. For example, right now, down in … And people when I say that, they wonder what I’m talking about. The biggest carbon sink in the world is the Amazon. More carbon absorbed from the air diminishing global warming in the Amazon than all the carbon emitted on a yearly basis from the United States of America from all vehicles on all means. So we have to use our imaginations. We have to move in the direction as well providing for electric vehicles. Electric vehicles will save billions of gallons of oil,  estimated, not me, Wall street, one million automobile jobs, but we’re lagging me. I mean, we’re not investing. We’re not doing any of the research. Good to be back home. I’m from Pennsylvania. Yep. A little more, but not a whole lot. We find ourselves in a position where we’re more isolated in the world than we’ve ever been. Our allies- Were more isolated in the world than we ever have been. Our allies… Our go it alone, our America first has made America alone. You have Iran closer to having enough nuclear material to build a bomb. North Korea has more bombs and missiles available to it. We find ourselves where our NATO allies are publicly saying they can’t count on us. We’re in a situation as well, where in the far East, we find ourselves, in the Western Pacific, where we’re isolated as well. You have Japan and South Korea at odds with one another. China is making moves. So I would say, we’re find ourselves less secure than we’ve been. I do compliment the president on the deal with Israel recently. But if you take a look, we’re not very well trusted around the world. When 17 major nations in the world were asked who they trust more, who’s a better leader, and the president came in behind both, the international survey, both behind Putin, as well as Xi. And look what Putin is doing. You have bounties on American militaries heads in Afghanistan. They have more people there now, by the way, than when we left in Afghanistan. And we find ourselves in a situation where he’s talked to Putin six times, hadn’t said a word to him. And NATO is on the risk of beginning crack because they doubt whether we’re there. You see what’s happened in everything from Belarus to Poland, to Hungary, and the rise of totalitarian regimes in the world. And as well as, this president embraces all the thugs in the world. He’s best friends with the leader of North Korea, sending love letters. He doesn’t take on Putin in any way. He’s learned the art of the steal from the art of the deal by Xi and China. So I would respectfully suggest, no, there is no plan, no coherent plan for foreign policy. We’ve been most effective as a world leader, in my humble opinion, not just by the exercise of our power. We’re the most powerful nation in the world, but the power of our example. That’s what’s led the rest of the world to follow us on almost everything. He’s pulled out of almost every international organization. He gets laughed at, literally, not figuratively, when he goes to the United Nations. It’s not about the president, per se. It’s about the nation and the lack of respect that’s shown to us. Hi, Mieke. How are you? I will flat out just change the law. Eliminate those executive orders, number one. You may recall, I’m the guy who said… I was raised by a man who, I remember, I was being dropped off. My dad was a high school educated, well-read man who was a really decent guy. And I was being dropped off to get an application in the center of our city, Wilmington, Delaware, the corporate capital of the world at the time. I’m getting out to get an application to be a lifeguard in the African-American community, because there was a big swimming pool complex. And these two men, well-dressed, leaned up and hugged one another and kissed one another. I’m getting out of the car at the light, and I turned to my dad. My dad looked me. He said, “Joey, it’s simple. They love each other.” The idea that an 8 year old child or a 10 year old child decides, “I decided I want to be transgender. That’s what I think I’d like to be. It’d make my life a lot easier.” There should be zero discrimination. And what’s happening is too many transgender women of color are being murdered. They’re being murdered. I think it’s up to, now, 17. Don’t hold me to that number, but it’s… It’s higher now? And that’s just this year. And so I promise you, there is no reason to suggest that there should be any right denied your daughter, or daughters, whichever, one or two. One. Your daughter, that your other daughter has a right to be and do. None. Zero. And by the way, my son Beau, who passed away, was the attorney general of the state of Delaware. He was the guy who got the first transgender law passed in the state of Delaware. And because of a young man who became a woman, who worked for him in the attorney general’s office. And I’m proud of her. Well, to be very honest with you, I think that’s very hard. Things have not let themselves to him learning from what’s happened, what’s gone before. Instead of being chastened by being one of the few presidents, the only president to be impeached and then have a member of his own party vote to expel him, it emboldened him. But what I will do… Hopefully, I’ll go back to being a professor at the University of Pennsylvania. And making the case that I’ve been made, and at the Biden Institute at the University of Delaware, focusing on these same issues, relating to what constitutes decency and honor in this country. It’s the thing that got me involved in public life to begin with. As a kid, I’d moved from Scranton, where there were no African-Americans and moved down to Claymont, Delaware. And in Delaware we have the eight largest Black population, as a percent of population. It was an epiphany for me seeing what was going on, and I got deeply involved. I’m no great shakes. I wasn’t John Lewis. I don’t mean to imply that. But it’s the thing that’s motivated… My dad used to have an expression for real. He said, “Everyone’s entitled to be treated with dignity. Everybody.” And it was real. Everybody is. And so whether I’m a defeated candidate for president back teaching or I’m elected president, it is a major element of everything that I’m about, because it reflects who we are as a nation. Every single solitary generation, the dial has moved closer and closer and more and more to inclusion. And we are a country that is a country of slaves who came here 400 years ago, Indigenous people, and everyone else is an immigrant. And we’re a diverse country. And unless we are able to treat people equally, we’re just never going to meet our potential. But I think the American people want to see that happen. I think they’re ready to see it happen. And I’d tell you one thing, if I’m elected president, you will not hear me race baiting. You’ll not hear me dividing. You’ll hear me trying to unify, and bring people together. When I said I was running because I wanted to unify the country, people said, “Well, there are the old days.” We better be able to do it again. We’d better be able to do it again. Well, it could say I’m a lousy candidate, and I didn’t do a good job. But I hope that it doesn’t say that we are as racially, ethnically, and religiously at odds with one another as it appears the president wants us to be. Usually, the president’s in my view, with all due respect, has been divide and conquer. The way he does better if he splits us. There’s division. And I think people need hope. Look, George, I’ve never been more optimistic about the prospect for this country than I am today. And I really mean that. I think the people are ready. They understand what’s at stake, and it’s not about Democrat or Republican. If I get elected, I’m running as a proud Democrat, but I’m going to be an American president. I’m going to take care of those who voted against me, as well as those who voted for me, for real. That’s a presence too. We got to heal this nation, because we have the greatest opportunity to any country in the world to own the 21st century. And we can’t do it divided. Yeah. And by the way, before I came up here, I took another test. I’ve been taking them every day, the deep test, the ones that go in most. Because if I had not passed that test, I didn’t want to come here and expose anybody. And I just think it’s just decency, to be able to determine whether or not you’re clear. I’m less concerned about me, but then the guys with the cameras, the people working in the Secret Service guys you drive up with, all those people. And so, yes, I believe he will do that. Look, I’m going to abide by what the commission rules call for. I was prepared to debate him remotely, which was supposed to happen. And he said he wouldn’t do that, a virtual debate, or a town hall. He didn’t want to do that. I didn’t set those rules. The commission set the rules. So whatever rules they set, I’m confident that the Cleveland Clinic is the one overseeing it. I think they’re going to not let happen what happened last time. They’re going to demand that it’s safe. I expect to be there.\",\n",
       " 'Trump': ' How are you doing? Thank you very much, Chris. I will tell you very simply. We won the election. Elections have consequences. We have the Senate, we have the White House, and we have a phenomenal nominee respected by all. Top, top academic, good in every way. Good in every way. In fact, some of her biggest endorsers are very liberal people from Notre Dame and other places. So I think she’s going to be fantastic. We have plenty of time. Even if we did it after the election itself. I have a lot of time after the election, as you know. So I think that she will be outstanding. She’s going to be as good as anybody that has served on that court. We really feel that. We have a professor at Notre Dame, highly respected by all, said she’s the single greatest student he’s ever had. He’s been a professor for a long time at a great school. And we won the election and therefore we have the right to choose her, and very few people knowingly would say otherwise. And by the way, the Democrats, they wouldn’t even think about not doing it. The only difference is they’d try and do it faster. There’s no way they would give it up. They had Merrick Garland, but the problem is they didn’t have the election so they were stopped. And probably that would happen in reverse, also. Definitely would happen in reverse. So we won the election and we have the right to do it, Chris. Thank you, Joe. There aren’t a hundred million people with pre-existing conditions. As far as a say is concerned, the people already had their say. Okay, Justice Ginsburg said very powerfully, very strongly, at some point 10 years ago or so, she said a President and the Senate is elected for a period of time, but a President is elected for four years. We’re not elected for three years. I’m not elected for three years. So we have the Senate, we have a President- During that period of time, during that period of time, we have an opening. I’m not elected for three years. I’m elected for four years. Joe, the hundred million people is totally wrong. I don’t know where you got that number. The bigger problem that you have is that you’re going to extinguish 180 million people with their private health care, that they’re very happy this. Well, you’re certainly going to socialist. You’re going to socialist medicine- That’s not what you’ve said and it’s not what your party is saying. Your party doesn’t say it. Your party wants to go socialist medicine and socialist healthcare. And they’re going to dominate you, Joe. You know that. Not according to Harris. Joe, you’ve had 308,000 military people dying because you couldn’t provide them proper healthcare in the military. So don’t tell me about this. And if you were here, it wouldn’t be 200, it would be two million people because you were very late on the draw. You didn’t want me to ban China, which was heavily infected. You didn’t want me to ban Europe. You would have been much later, Joe, much later. We’re talking about two million people. You don’t know what’s on the ballot. Why is it on the ballot? Why is it on the ballot? It’s not on the ballot. I don’t think so. There’s nothing happening there. You don’t know her view on Roe V. Wade? You don’t know here view. That’s right. Because they want to give good healthcare. Yes, I have. Of course, I have. The individual mandate. Excuse me. I got rid of the individual mandate, which was a big chunk of Obamacare. That is absolutely a big thing. That was the worst part of Obamacare. Chris, that was the worst part of Obamacare. Well, I’ll ask Joe. The individual mandate was the most unpopular aspect of Obamacare. I got rid of it. And we will protect people. Go ahead. Well, first of all, I guess I’m debating you, not him, but that’s okay. I’m not surprised. Let me just tell you something. There’s nothing symbolic. I’m cutting drug prices. I’m going with Favored Nations, which no President has the courage to do because you’re going against big pharma. Drug prices will be coming down 80 or 90%. You could have done it during your 47 year period in government, but you didn’t do it. Nobody’s done it. So we’re cutting healthcare. All of the things that we’ve done. I’ll give you an example. Insulin, it was destroying families, destroying people, the cost. I’m getting it for so cheap it’s like water, you want to know the truth. So cheap. Take a look at all of the drugs that what we’re doing. Prescription drug prices, we’re going to allow our Governors now to go to other countries to buy drugs because when they paid just a tiny fraction of what we do. This is big stuff. That’s not what your party says, by the way. Joe, you agreed with Bernie Sanders, who’s far left, on the manifesto, we call it. And that gives you socialized medicine. Are you saying you didn’t agree? Not by much. Not by much. If Pocahontas would have left two days early you would have lost every primary. On Super Tuesday, you got very lucky. With what? With what? But you agree. Joe, you’re the liar. You graduated last in your class not first in your class. You’d be surprised. You’d be surprised. Go ahead, Joe. Listen, you agreed with Bernie Sanders and the manifesto. He just lost the left. You just lost the left. You agreed with Bernie Sanders on a plan that you absolutely agreed to and under that plan , they call it socialized medicine. Who is, Bernie? No, I want to give them better healthcare at a much lower price, because Obamacare is no good. I’ve already fixed it. We’ve already fixed it to an extent. Obamacare, as you might know but probably don’t, Obamacare is no good. Obamacare is no good. We made it better and I had a choice to make very early on. We took away the individual mandate. We guaranteed pre-existing conditions, but took away the individual mandate. Listen, this is the way it is. And that destroyed … They shouldn’t even call it Obamacare, then I had a choice to make, do I let my people run it really well or badly? If I run it badly, they’ll probably blame him, but they’ll blame me. But more importantly, I want to help people. Okay. I said, “You’ve got to run it so well.” And I just had a meeting with them. They said the problem is, no matter how well you run Obamacare, it’s a disaster. It’s too expensive. Premiums are too high, that it doesn’t work. So we do want to get rid of it. Chris, we want to get rid of that and give something that’s cheaper and better. Go ahead. Good. Of course, we do. Are you going to pack the court? Are you going to pack the court? He doesn’t want to answer the question. Why wouldn’t you answer that question? You want to put a lot of new Supreme Court Justices. Radical left. Listen, who is on your list, Joe? Who’s on your list? He’s going to pack the court. He is not going to give a list. The people understand, Joe. 47 years, you’ve done nothing. They’re understand. Wrong. Wrong. It’s so wrong. So, if we would have listened to you. If we would’ve listened to you, the country would have been left wide open, millions of people would have died, not 200,000. And one person is too much. It’s China’s fault. It should have never happened. They stopped it from going in, but it was China’s fault. And, by the way, when you talk about numbers, you don’t know how many people died in China. You don’t know how many people died in Russia. You don’t know how many people died in India. They don’t exactly give you a straight count, just so you understand. But if you look at what we’ve done, I closed it and you said, “He’s xenophobic. He’s a racist and he’s xenophobic,” because you didn’t think I should have closed our country. Wait a minute. You didn’t think we should have closed our country because you thought it was terrible. You wouldn’t have closed it for another two months. By my doing it early, in fact, Dr. Fauci said, “President Trump saved thousands of lives.” Many of your Democrat Governors said, “President Trump did a phenomenal job.” We worked with the Governor. Oh really, go take a look. The Governors said I did a phenomenal job. Most of them said that. In fact, people that would not be necessarily on my side said that, “President Trump did a phenomenal job.” We did. We got the gowns. We got the masks. We made the ventilators. You wouldn’t have made ventilators. And now we’re weeks away from a vaccine. We’re doing therapeutics already. Fewer people are dying when they get sick. Far fewer people are dying. We’ve done a great job. The only thing I haven’t done a good job, and that’s because of the fake news, no matter what you say to them, they give you a bad press on it. It’s just fake news. They give you good press, they give me bad press because that’s the way it is, unfortunately. But let me just say something. I don’t care. I’ve gotten used to it. But I’ll tell you, Joe, you could never have done the job that we did. You don’t have it in your blood. You could’ve never done that, Joe. Well, you didn’t do very well in Swine Flu. H1-N1, you were a disaster. Your own Chief of Staff said you were a disaster. A far less lethal disease, by the way. We would have lost far more people, far more people. You would have been months late. You’re months behind me, Joe. You don’t trust Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer? Well, I’ve spoken to the companies and we can have it a lot sooner. It’s a very political thing because people like this would rather make it political than save lives. It is a very political thing. I’ve spoken to Pfizer, I’ve spoken to all of the people that you have to speak to, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, and others. They can go faster than that by a lot. It’s become very political because the left… Or I don’t know if I call them left, I don’t know what I call them. I disagree with him. No, I disagree with both of them. And he didn’t say that. He said it could be there, but it could also be much sooner. I had him in my office two days ago. Because he said it’s a possibility that we’ll have the answer before November 1st. It could also be after that. Well, we’re going to deliver it right away. We have the military all set up. Logistically, they’re all set up. We have our military that delivers soldiers and they can do 200,000 a day. They’re going to be delivering- It’s all set up. That was said sarcastically, and you know that. That was said sarcastically. You’ll have the vaccine sooner than that. We spoke to the scientists that are in charge- … they will have the vaccine very soon. Did you use the word smart? So you said you went to Delaware State, but you forgot the name of your college. You didn’t go to Delaware State. You graduated either the lowest or almost the lowest in your class. Don’t ever use the word smart with me. Don’t ever use that word. Because you know what? There’s nothing smart about you, Joe. 47 years you’ve done nothing. Let me just tell you something, Joe. If you would have had the charge of what I was put through, I had to close the greatest economy of the history of our country. And by the way, now it’s being built again and it’s going up fast. Okay. It’s going up fast. I look forward to talking about it. Tell that to Nancy Pelosi. Tell that to Nancy Pelosi, and Schumer  Chuck. You probably play more than I do, Joe. Well, he wants to shut down this country and I want to keep it open, and we did a great thing by shutting it down- Wait a minute, Joe. Let me shut you down for a second, Joe, just for one second. He wants to shut down the country. We just went through it. We had to, because we didn’t know anything about the disease. Now we’ve found that elderly people with heart problems and diabetes and different problems are very, very vulnerable. We learned a lot. Young children aren’t, even younger people aren’t. We’ve learned a lot, but he wants to shut it down. More people will be hurt by continuing. If you look at Pennsylvania, if you look at certain states that have been shut down, they have Democrat governors, all, one of the reasons they shut down is because they want to keep it shut down until after the election on November 3rd. Because it’s a political thing. But those states- Those states are not doing well that are shut down right now. He wants to shut down the whole country. No, I think masks are okay. You have to understand, if you look… I mean, I have a mask right here. I put a mask on when I think I need it. Tonight, as an example, everybody’s had a test and you’ve had social distancing and all of the things that you have to, but I wear masks- … when needed. When needed, I wear masks. I don’t wear a mask like him. Every time you see him, he’s got a mask. He could be speaking 200 feet away from him and he shows up with the biggest mask I’ve ever seen. I will say this- And they’ve also said the opposite. They’ve also said- Dr. Fauci. Dr. Fauci said the opposite. He said very strongly, “Masks are not good.” Then he changed his mind. He said, “Masks are good.” I’m okay with masks. I’m not fighting masks. Outside. Because nobody will show up. Well, it’s true. Nobody shows up to his rallies. Because people want to hear what I have to say. I mean- … I’m doing my job as a president, and I’ll have 25, 35,000 people show up at airports. We use airports and hangers and we have a lot of people- Well, so far we have had no problem whatsoever. It’s outside. That’s a big difference according to the experts. We do them outside, we have tremendous crowds, as you see, and literally on 24 hours notice. And Joe does the circles and has three people someplace. We’ve had no negative effect. We’ve had no negative effect, and we’ve had 35, 40,000 people at these rallies. If you could get the crowds, you would have done the same thing. But you can’t. Nobody cares. No cares. Yes. Much faster. So we built the greatest economy in history. We closed it down because of the China plague. When the plague came in, we closed it down, which was very hard psychologically to do. He didn’t think we should close it down and he was wrong. Again, two million people would be dead now instead of… Still, 204,000 people is too much. One person is too much. Should have never happened from China. But what happened is we closed it down and now we’re reopening and we’re doing record business. We had 10.4 million people in a four month period that we’ve put back into the workforce. That’s a record the likes of which nobody’s ever seen before. And he wants to close down the… He will shut it down again. He will destroy this country. A lot of people, between drugs and alcohol and depression, when you start shutting it down, you take a look at what’s happening at some of your Democrat-run states where they have these tough shutdowns. And I’m telling you it’s because they don’t want to open it. One of them came out last week, you saw that, “Oh, we’re going to open up on November 9th.” Why November 9th? Because it’s after the election. They think they’re hurting us by keeping them closed. They’re hurting people. People know what to do. They can social distance. They can wash their hands, they can wear masks. They can do whatever they want, but they got to open these states up. When you look at North Carolina, when you look, and these governors are under siege, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and a couple of others, you got to open these states up. It’s not fair. You’re talking about almost it’s like being in prison. And you look at what’s going on with divorce, look at what’s going on with alcoholism and drugs. It’s a very, very sad thing. And he’ll close down the whole country. This guy will close down the whole country and destroy our country. Our country is coming back incredibly well, setting records as it does it. We don’t need somebody to come in and say, “Let’s shut it down.” That’s wrong. . I have to respond to that. Excuse me, he made a statement. No, people want their schools open. They don’t want to be shut down. They don’t want their state shut down. They want their restaurants. I look at New York. It’s so sad what’s happening in New York. It’s almost like a ghost town, and I’m not sure it can ever recover what they’ve done to New York. People want their places open. They want to get back to their lives. They’ll be careful, but they want their schools open. I’m the one that brought back football. By the way, I brought back Big Ten football. It was me and I’m very happy to do it- … and people of Ohio are very proud of me. And you know how I found out? When . I paid millions of dollars in taxes, millions of dollars of income tax. And let me just tell you, there was a story in one of the papers that paid- I paid $38 million one year, I paid $27 million one year. You’ll see it as soon as it’s finished, you’ll see it. You know, if you wanted to, go to the Board of Elections. There’s 118 page or so report that says everything I have, every bank I have, I’m totally under leveraged because the assets are extremely good, and I built a great company. But let me tell you- Let me- Millions of dollars. Millions of dollars, yes. Millions of dollars. And you’ll get to see it. And you’ll get to see it. But let me just tell you- Chris, let me just say something, that it was the tax laws. I don’t want to pay tax. Before I came here, I was a private developer, I was a private business people. Like every other private person, unless they’re stupid, they go through the laws, and that’s what it is. He passed a tax bill that gave us all these privileges for depreciation and for tax credits. We build the building and we get tax credits, like the hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue. Which by the way, was given to me by the Obama administration, if you can believe that. Now the man got fired right after that happened, but that’s- That’s okay. But why didn’t you do it over the last 25 years? Why didn’t you do it over the last 25 years? You were a Senator and - Hey, Joe, let me just tell you, Joe. In 47 months, I’ve done more than you’ve done in 47 years, Joe. We’ve done things that you never even thought of doing. Including fixing the broken military that you gave me, including taking care of your debts. He has none. Why didn’t you do it before, when you were vice president with Obama? I got it done. And you know what happened? Our economy boomed like it’s never boomed before. Excuse me. They had the slowest economic recovery since 1929. It was the slowest recovery. Also, they took over something that was down here. All you had to do is turn on the lights and you pick up a lot. But they had the slowest economic recovery since 1929, and let me tell you about the stock market. When the stock market goes up, that means jobs. It also means 401ks. If you got in, if you ever became president with your ideas, you want to terminate my taxes. I’ll tell you what, you’ll lose. Half of the companies that have poured in here will leave. And plenty of companies that are already here, they’ll leave for other places.  They will leave and you will have a depression, the likes of which you’ve never seen. It wasn’t blooming. He was in booming. It was the weakest recovery since 1929. When COVID came along. Excuse me, Chris, wait. Chris. They said it would take… No, you’re on number two. Chris, Chris. They said it would take- … a miracle to bring back manufacturing. I brought back 700,000 jobs. They brought back nothing. They gave up on manufacturing. … standard fare. He totally gave up on manufacturing. Ohio had the best year it’s ever had last year. Michigan had the best year they’ve ever had. Many car companies came in from Germany, from Japan, went to Michigan, went to Ohio and they didn’t come in with you. . China ate your lunch- . China ate your lunch, Joe. And no wonder your son goes in and he takes out billions of dollars. He takes out billions of dollars to manage. He makes millions of dollars. And also, while we’re at it, why is it just out of curiosity, the mayor of Moscow’s wife gave you a son three and a half million dollars? What did he do to deserve it? What did he do with- … to deserve $183,000? Oh really, he didn’t get three and a half million? Well wait, he didn’t get three and a half million dollars, Joe? He got three and a half million- … dollars. Oh, really? It’s a fact. Did Burisma pay him 183,000 a month, with no experience in energy? I think he did. By who? The media. By the media, because they refuse to talk about it- … because they’re embarrassed. So let me ask you this, Joe- . He got three and a half million dollars from Moscow. Oh, really? I’d like to know who they are. I’ll fire them. Some people don’t do a good job. Hey, let me just tell you, Joe- Three and a half million, Joe. Why did he deserve three and a half million from Moscow? My family- My family lost a fortune by coming down and helping us with governance. Every single one of them lost a fortune- Chris, can I be honest? It’s a very important question- He stood up- … and the threatened Ukraine- … with a billion dollars- Well, and him too. Well, that’s all right, but he does plenty. He does plenty. Oh yeah, sure. That’s true. So- You did a crime bill, 1994, where you call them super predators. African-Americans are super predators and they’ve never forgotten it. They’ve never forgotten it. So you did that and they call you a super predator and I’m letting people out of jail now, that you have treated the African-American population community, you have treated the black community about as bad as anybody in this country. You did the 1990… And that’s why, if you look at the polls, I’m doing better than any Republican has done in a long time, because they saw what you did. You call them super predators, and you’ve called them worse than that. Because you look back at your testimony over the years, you’ve called them a lot worse than that. As far as the church is concerned and as far as the generals are concerned, we just got the support of 250 military leaders and generals, total support. Law enforcement, almost every law enforcement group in the United States. I have Florida. I have Texas. I have Ohio. I have every… Excuse me, Portland, the sheriff just came out today and he said, “I support President Trump.” I don’t think you have any law enforcement. You can’t even say the word law enforcement. Because if you say those words, you’re going to lose all of your radical left supporters. And why aren’t you saying those words, Joe? Why don’t you say the words law enforcement? Because you know what? If called us in Portland, we would put out that fire in a half an hour. But they won’t do it, because they’re run by radical left Democrats. If you look at Chicago, if you look at any place you want to look, Seattle, they heard we were coming in the following day and they put up their hands and we got back Seattle. Minneapolis, we got it back, Joe, because we believe in law and order, but you don’t. The top 10 cities and just about the top 40 cities are run by Democrats, and in many cases radical left. And they’ve got you wrapped around their finger, Joe, to a point where you don’t want to say anything about law and order. And I’ll tell you what, the people of this country want and demand law and order and you’re afraid to even say it. What is peaceful protest? When they run through the middle of the town- … and burn down your stores and kill people all over the place- . No it’s not, but you say it is. Fine. I ended it because it’s racist. I ended it because a lot of people were complaining that they were asked to do things that were absolutely insane. That it a radical revolution that was taking place in our military, in our schools, all over the place. And you know it, and so does everybody else. And he would know it- If you were a certain person, you had no status in life. It was sort of a reversal. And if you look at the people, we were paying people hundreds of thousands of dollars to teach very bad ideas and frankly, very sick ideas. And really, they were teaching people to hate our country And I’m not going to do that. I’m not going to allow that to happen. We have to go back to the core values of this country. They were teaching people that our country is a horrible place. It’s a racist place. And they were teaching people to hate our country. And I’m not going to allow that to happen. You just don’t know. During the Obama-Biden administration, there was tremendous division. There was hatred. You look at Ferguson, you look at, or you go to very… Many places, look at Oakland. Look what happened in Oakland. Look what happened in Baltimore. Look what happened… Frankly, it was more violent than what I’m even seeing now. But the reason- … is that the Democrats that run these cities- … don’t want to talk, like you, about law and order. And you still haven’t mentioned. Are you in favor of law and order? Are you in favor of law and order? Okay. It went down much more in ours. The places we had trouble were democratic run cities- I think as a party issue, you can bring in a couple of examples but if you look at Chicago, what’s going on in Chicago where a 53 people were shot and eight died shot, if you look at New York where it’s going up, like nobody’s ever seen anything. The numbers are going up a 100%, 150%, 200% crime, it is crazy what’s going on and he doesn’t want to say law and order because he can’t because he’ll lose his radical left supporters and once he does that, it’s over with. But if he ever got to run this country and they ran it the way he would want to run it, we would have by the way our suburbs would be gone. And you would see problems like you’ve never seen before. Oh, I know suburbs so much that you. That’s not what they are talking about this. That’s not what it is about. He’s talking about defunding the police. He doesn’t have any law support. He has no law enforcement. He has almost nothing. Oh, really, who do you have name one group that supports you name one group that came out and supported you. Go ahead. Think we have time. No, no think right now. Name one law enforcement group that came out in support of you. There aren’t any. He’s never done that. Oh really? I sent in the US Marshalls to get the killer of a young man in the middle of the street and they shot him for three days Portland didn’t do anything. I sent in the US Marshals they took care of business. I don’t know who said that. Who? I don’t think she said that. I don’t think so. Does it mean I have to answer his stuff. Wait a second, you have made a statement. I would love to end it. I’ll send in the National Guard, it would be over. That’d be no problem. But I don’t want to accept the National Guard. Sure, I’m will to do that. I would say almost everything I see is from the left wing not from the right wing. I’m willing to do anything. I want to see peace. What do you want to call them? Give me a name, give me a name, go ahead who do you want me to condemn. Proud Boys, stand back and stand by. But I’ll tell you what somebody’s got to do something about Antifa and the left because this is not a right wing problem this is a left wing… Oh you got to be kidding me. Well, then you know what, he’s wrong. Antifa is bad. You know what, Antifa is a dangerous radical group. And you ought to be careful of them, they’ll over throw you. Because there is never been an administration or president who has done more than I’ve done in a period of three and a half years. And that’s despite the impeachment hoax and you so what happened today with Hillary Clinton, where it was a whole big con job. But despite going through all of these things where I had a fight, both flanks and behind me and above there has never been an administration that’s done what I’ve done. The greatest, before COVID came in the greatest economy in history, lowest unemployment numbers, everything was good. Everything was going. And by the way, there was unity going to happen. People were calling me for the first time in years, they were calling and they were saying it’s time maybe and then what happened? We got hit. But now we’re building it back up again. A rebuilding of the military, including Space Force and all of the other things. A fixing of the VA which was a mess under him, 308,000 people died because they didn’t have proper health care. It was a mess. And we now got a 91% approval rating at the VA, our vets. We take care of our vets. But we’ve rebuilt our military. And I’ll tell you something, some people say maybe the most important by the end of the first term I’ll have approximately 300 Federal judges and Court of Appeals judges, 300 and hopefully three great Supreme Court judges, justices that is a record the likes of which very few people and one of the reasons I’ll have so many judges because President Obama and him left me 128 judges to fill. When you leave office, you don’t leave any judges. That’s like, you just don’t do that. They left 128 openings and if I were a member of his party, because they have a little different philosophy, I’d say, if you left us 128 openings you can’t be a good president. You can’t be a good vice president but I want to thank you because it gives us almost, it’ll probably be above that number. By the end of this term, 300 judges. It’s a record. You son got three and a half million dollars. Really? Are you talking Hunter, are you talking about Hunter. I don’t know Beau. I know Hunter. Hunter got thrown out of the military. He was thrown out dishonorably discharged. For cocaine use. And he didn’t have a job until you became vice president. Once you became vice president he made a fortune in Ukraine, in China, in Moscow and various other places. He made a fortune and he didn’t have a job. But why was he given tens of millions of dollars? I know but when somebody gets three and a half million dollars from the Mayor of Moscow. Why did he get it? I want crystal clean water and air. I want beautiful clean air. We have now the lowest carbon… If you look at our numbers right now, we are doing phenomenally. But I haven’t destroyed our businesses. Our businesses aren’t put out of commission. If you look at the Paris Accord, it was a disaster from our standpoint. And people are actually very happy about what’s going on because our businesses are doing well. As far as the fires are concerned, you need forest management. In addition to everything else, the forest floors are loaded up with trees, dead trees that are years old and they’re like tinder and leaves and everything else. You drop a cigarette in there the whole forest burns down. You’ve got to have forest management. I believe that we have to do everything we can to have immaculate air immaculate water and do whatever else we can that’s good. We’re planting a billion trees, the Billion Tree Project and it’s very exciting for a lot of people. I think a lot of things do, but I think to an extent, yes. I think to an extent, yes, but I also think we have to do better management of our forest. Every year I get the call. California’s burning, California’s burning. If that was cleaned, if that were, if you had forest management, good forest management, you wouldn’t be getting those calls. In Europe, they live they’re forest cities. They call forest cities. They maintain their forest. They manage their forest. I was with the head of a major country, it’s a forest city. He said, “Sir, we have trees that are far more, they ignite much easier than California. There shouldn’t be that problem.” I spoke with the Governor about it. I’m getting along very well with the governor. But I said, “At some point you can’t every year have hundreds of thousands of acres of land just burned to the ground.” That’s burning down because of a lack of management. Because it was driving energy prices through the sky. Well, not really because what’s happening is the car is much less expensive and it’s a much safer car and you talk it about a tiny difference. And then what would happen because of the cost of the car you would have at least double and triple the number of cars purchased. We have the old slugs out there that are 10, 12 years old. If you did that, the car would be safer. It would be much cheaper by $3,500. No, but you would take a lot of cars off the market because people would be able to afford a car. Now, by the way, we’re going to see how that turns out. But a lot of people agree with me, many people. The car has gotten so expensive because they have computers all over the place for an extra little bit of gasoline. And I’m okay with electric cars too. I think I’m all for electric cars. I’ve given big incentives for electric cars but what they’ve done in California is just crazy. Not true. Not true- He’s talking about the Green New Deal. And it’s not 2 billion  or 20 billion, as you said . It’s $100 trillion. And rebuild the building. It’s the dumbest- … most ridiculous  where two car systems are out- … where they want to take out the cows too. That’s not true either, right? This is a 100 trillion- That’s more money than our country could make in 100 years - 100 million dollars. I never said that at all- They made it up. You make up a lot- Wait a minute, Chris. So why didn’t he do it for 47 years? You were vice president- So why didn’t you get the world… China sends up real dirt into the air. Russia does. India does. They all do. We’re supposed to be good. And by the way, he made a couple of statements. The Green New Deal is a hundred trillion dollars. He made a statement about the military. He said I said something about the military. He and his friends made it up, and then they went with it. I never said it. He called the military stupid bastards. He said it on tape. - I would never say that - You’re on tape- Oh, you don’t? Oh, well, that’s a big statement. You just lost the radical left. So when I listen to Joe talking about a transition, there has been no transition from when I won. I won that election. And if you look at crooked Hillary Clinton, if you look at all of the different people, there was no transition, because they came after me trying to do a coup. They came after me spying on my campaign. They started from the day I won, and even before I won. From the day I came down the escalator with our first lady, they were a disaster. They were a disgrace to our country, and we’ve caught them. We’ve caught them all. We’ve got it all on tape. We’ve caught them all. And by the way, you gave the idea for the Logan Act against General Flynn. You better take a look at that, because we caught you in a sense, and President Obama was sitting in the office. He knew about it too. So don’t tell me about a free transition. As far as the ballots are concerned, it’s a disaster. A solicited ballot, okay, solicited, is okay. You’re soliciting. You’re asking. They send it back. You send it back. I did that. If you have an unsolicited… They’re sending millions of ballots all over the country. There’s fraud. They found them in creeks. They found some, just happened to have the name Trump just the other day in a wastepaper basket. They’re being sent all over the place. They sent two in a Democrat area. They sent out a thousand ballots. Everybody got two ballots. This is going to be a fraud like you’ve never seen. The other thing, it’s nice. On November 3rd, you’re watching, and you see who won the election. And I think we’re going to do well because people are really happy with the job we’ve done. But you know what? We won’t know. We might not know for months because these ballots are going to be all over. Take a look at what happened in Manhattan. Take a look at what happened in New Jersey. Take a look at what happened in Virginia and other places. They’re not losing 2%, 1%, which by the way is too much. An election could be won or lost with that. They’re losing 30 and 40%. It’s a fraud, and it’s a shame. And can you imagine where they say, “You have to have your ballot in by November 10th.” November 10th. That’s seven days after the election, in theory, should have been announced. We have major states  with that- … all run by Democrats- All run by Democrats. It’s a rigged election. Yeah. I think I’m counting on them to look at the ballots, definitely. I hope we don’t need them, in terms of the election itself. But for the ballots, I think so, because what’s happening is incredible. I read today where at least 1% of the ballots for 2016 were invalidated. They take them. We don’t like them. We don’t like them. They throw them out- … left and right. What you do is you go and vote. You do a solicited ballot, and that’s okay- You go and vote. You go and vote- You either do, Chris, a solicited ballot, where you’re sending it in, they’re sending it back and you’re sending. They have mailmen with lots of it. Did you see what’s going on? Take a look at West Virginia, mailman selling the ballots. They’re being sold. They’re being dumped in rivers. This is a horrible thing for our country. This is not going to end well. This is not going to end well- You’re wrong. You’re wrong . I love counting the votes - Chris, he’s so wrong when he makes a statement like that- Excuse me - You know it can’t be done. You know it can’t, and already, there’s been fraud - Could be months- I’m urging my supporters to go in to the polls and watch very carefully, because that’s what has to happen. I am urging them to do it. As you know, today there was a big problem. In Philadelphia, they went in to watch. They’re called poll watchers, a very safe, very nice thing. They were thrown out. They weren’t allowed to watch. You know why? Because bad things happen in Philadelphia. Bad things. And I am urging my people. I hope it’s going to be a fair election. If it’s a fair election- … I am 100% on board. But if I see tens of thousands of ballots being manipulated, I can’t go along with that. And I’ll tell you why- … from a common sense- I’ll tell you what it means- It means you have a fraudulent election. You’re sending out 80 million ballots- They’re not equipped… These people aren’t equipped to handle it, number one. Number two, they cheat. They cheat. Hey, they found ballots in a wastepaper basket three days ago, and they all had the name military ballots. There were military. They all had the name Trump on them. You think that’s good? It’s already been established. Take a look at Carolyn Maloney’s race- I want to see an honest ballot cut- I want to see an honest ballot count. And I think he does too- Hello, everybody. Hello, Duluth. Hello, Duluth. Thank you. Thirty-four days from now, we’re going to win Minnesota. We’re going to go and win four more beautiful years in the White House and do more than anybody’s ever done before from the White House. We’re looking to set records. I really enjoyed last night’s debate with Sleepy Joe. I brought those hats out here because Minnesota is a little on the windy side. Like a genius, I sent them all out, and I’m getting blown to fishes, then that’s fine. That’s okay. I love it. I love you to have whatever we have. We have it together, that I can tell you. The verdict is in and they say that we, we, all of us, won big last night. I don’t know. Did you hear about this? In the history of cable television, it had the highest ratings of any show in the history of cable television. It had the second highest ratings of overall television in the history of television. Does anybody know what was first? Like M*A*S*H or something? I guess M*A*S*H, they had the final episode of M*A*S*H, and I don’t know what was first. Does anybody know? But we were second in the history of all of television, but the biggest ratings in the history of cable television. It’s an honor. Last night, I did want the corrupt media has refused to do. I held Joe Biden accountable for his 47 years of lie, 47 years of betrayal, and 47 years of failure. I held Joe accountable for shipping your jobs and dreams abroad, and for bowing to the violent mob at home. Can you imagine these people the way they take over these Democrats cities? I don’t even believe it. The whole nation saw the truth. Did you see last night, name one, I said, “Sleepy Joe, name one law enforcement group that supports you.” Then, Chris Wallace says, “Don’t do that.” Can you believe this guy? I was debating two people last night. I was debating two people last night. Joe Biden is too weak to lead this country. You know Biden lost badly when his supporters are saying he should cancel the rest of the debates. Now, I understand he’s canceling the debates. Let’s see what happens. I think that’s not going to be a good move. I don’t think that’s going to be a good move. Television, with those ratings, they’re never going to let them cancel. You don’t know television like that. What are they going to do? Someday, we’re not going to be doing this anymore. What are they going to do without Trump? What are they going to do? Those poor people. Look at all of them, whoa. That’s a lot of people. What are they going to do? What are they going to do when in eight, 12, maybe 16 years, I said, “Let’s hang it up. Let’s hang it up.” 16 more years. But what he’s doing is what you do when you lose. So, let’s see what he does. I don’t think he’s going to get that. I’ve got news for Joe. If you ever became president, you have to deal with some of the toughest people in the world, and Chris Wallace is very, very easy by comparison. I will tell you. I know him. I know him well. Liberal media is upset that I took the fight to Biden and exposed his very dangerous agenda. There’s a beauty. Here we go. Here we go. There’s another beauty out there. Go home to mom. Go home. Go home to mom. These are the same media outlets cheering violent demonstrations in the streets, CNN, the New York Times. They think rioting is just, “Okay, just do whatever you want.” You can do whatever you want. You don’t have to wear a mask. You just riot, 25,000 people standing on each other’s face. Do whatever you want. Can you go to church? No. Can you go to restaurants? No. Can you do anything? No, but you can riot. That’s okay. Arson’s okay, but challenging Sleepy Joe is totally off limits. So, disappointed in Fox. I’m not just running against Joe Biden. I’m running against the corrupt far-left media, socialists, and communists, and the Democrat Party, and the special interests who’ve made a living bleeding our country dry. That’s what’s happened for too long. We’ve turned it around, but don’t forget when they turned it around, I had to fight other things like a fake impeachment. I had to fight a lot of things that are not like it wasn’t in the agenda. Never forget that we fought it very well, and frankly, we had great support from the Republican Party except for one person, but that’s all right. We had great support. Never forget they are coming after me because I am fighting for you, and that’s true. This is a choice election. Our opponents put America last. I put America first, and that’s what I’ve been doing for three and a half years. Our opponents want to erase borders. I will defend our borders. You see what’s going on in the southern border. By the way, that wall, 350 miles already, got to be finished very soon. They don’t talk about the wall anymore, fellas. What’s going on? They don’t talk about it. They used to talk about it every day, “He’s not going to get his financing.” But when you’re a real estate developer, you always get financing. This was easy. “He’s not going to get his financing.” Then, we got our finance, they don’t talk about it anymore. We’re up to 300, almost 360 miles. We’re doing about 10 miles a week. Yeah, Mexico is paying for it. You do know that, right? They keep saying, “There’s going to be a border charge at the border for the trucks and cars.” It won’t even have to be a lot. There’s so many cars and trucks going through, but Mexico is paying for it and they’ve been great. They have 27,000 soldiers right now on our border, and we appreciate it. We appreciate the President of Mexico. Our opponents will send your jobs to China. I will keep your jobs in America. Our opponents want to erase our nation’s core value, and I want to defend, preserve our nation’s historic values. Our opponents stand with rioters. I stand with the heroes of law enforcement. Did you see last night? I said, “Say the words, don’t even say good or bad. Sleepy Joe, say law enforcement.” He goes, “No, I’d rather not.” “Say law enforcement, Sleepy Joe.” “Law enforcement with safety.” “No, no, no. Just law enforcement.” They tell me that all time, too, please just say law enforcement with safety. No, it’s just law enforcement. It’s very simple. It’s a very simple term. Not with safety, unsafety. It’s law enforcement. He wouldn’t say it. Then, I said, “Name one group in the entire nation,” I’ve got Minnesota now, I’ve got everybody, “name one group in the entire nation from law enforcement that’s supporting you.” Well, well, well, thank Chris Wallace, “Okay. let’s go to the next question. He’s in trouble. He’s in trouble. Let me protect him for Fox.” Joe Biden says, antifa is just an idea. Well, ideas don’t assault cops and they don’t burn down buildings. Antifa is a domestic terrorist organization. I proudly received the endorsement of the Fraternal Order of Police, the National Association of Police Organizations, the National Troopers Coalition, the International Union of Police Associations, and law enforcement organizations and departments in Florida, Ohio, North Carolina, Colorado, Arizona, Nevada, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Minnesota. Good. I was getting worried. Texas, New York’s finest. They’d never done it before. They came in New York’s finest, you see great people, they could solve that problem in two minutes. All they want is their authority back. It’s been taken away from them, horribly. New York’s finest never endorsed a candidate for president before, and they’re great people. They can do it. New Jersey, Illinois, and many, many more. I won’t bore you, but I could go on and on that. I just said, “Joe, give me one, please.” He was joking. I’ll tell you, he got saved. Joe Biden is saying he owns the socialism and extremism in his party, that he owns it. You know it’s not his party. It’s not Joe’s party. You got crazy Bernie, you have AOC plus three, you got all these crazy people, these maniacs, you have the green new deal. How about the green new deal? He disavowed it. Then, he said, “No, I agree with it.” I said, “Joe, it’s a hundred trillion dollars. That’s more money than this country can make in the next hundred years if everything’s perfect.” It’s so crazy. He wants to rebuild every building. Take it down and rebuild every building. Let’s see, does that include the Empire State? Well, let’s take it down and rebuild it. These people are crazy. No, more cows, no more airplanes, no more nothing. Biden even vowed to eliminate our tax cuts. That means he’ll take away your child tax credits, because I gave you child tax credits, a thousand dollars a child. He wants to take away what I gave you and revoke our historic tax relief, right to the middle-class it went. Joe Biden also refused to answer questions about packing the Supreme Court. Don’t you love the Supreme Court? How good is Amy? How good is Amy? How good is Amy? Her professor at Notre Dame, one of the most highly respected … Fill that seat, fill that seat. You better believe it. How good is she? So, her professor, one of her professors, one of the most highly respected legal scholars in the country said, “I’ve been teaching for a long time,” said, “she is the finest.” She was first in her class, graduated first in her class. He said she is the finest student he’s ever had. Of all the students, thousands of students, she’s the single best student that he’s ever had. You know what I’m saying? She would have run for president instead of Joe. He was like last in his class. Can you imagine? This is a big difference. I don’t know. How do you like Amy for the Supreme Court? Yes? If he gets elected, the hard left will appoint radical justice- If he gets elected, the hard left will appoint radical justices who will terminate the second amendment. No more guns. No more guns. As you all saw, Biden also refused to explain why his son Hunter was paid $3.5 billion protected by Chris, by the wife of the former mayor of Moscow. And they talk about me with Russia. I have nothing to do with Russia. And took out $1.5 billion from China. He manages, makes millions of dollars a year. Right? Then he got the 183. Right? $183,000 a month. Would anybody like that job? You don’t have a job. You’re not employed. You get thrown out of the military for unfortunate reasons. Your father becomes vice-president and you get hired for $183,000 a month with I think a $3 million upfront payment. I think they could have had him for less. Would anybody take that job? And he knows nothing about energy. What do you know about energy? Well, that’s not my thing. Oh, that’s okay. I mean, could you imagine if I did it? How about when sleep Joe said, “You’re not getting the $1 billion unless you get rid of the prosecutor. When you get rid of the prosecutor we’ll send you the money.” They got rid of the prosecutor. He said, “Now the money comes.” I mean, can you imagine if I said that? Unbelievable. And the press doesn’t want to talk about it. And Chris Wallace is like, “We don’t want to discuss that.” Oh really, Chris? It’s so sad. I’ll tell you. It’s so hypocritical. So sad. This is a matter of national security and economic security. The Bidens got rich while American workers got robbed. How can you deal with China if you take out three and a half billion dollars and make all sorts of money? How can you do it? A critical issue in this election, you saw what I did with China, billions and billions a year, they pay us. I gave a lot of it to the farmers, $28 billion. A critical issue because they were targeted by China. A critical issue in this election is the future of the Minnesota Iron Range. You know what. That’s why I’m here. This was just supposed to be a little get together. And then they said, “Sir, we got thousands of people want to show up. I don’t know.” I don’t know how many are involved. This is the best to be an Iron Range get together. But it turns out big. Biden has 20, 30 people. He’s got those circles. Today he had a little bit more like 30 or 40, but they were too close together. I sent him a note to Joe. They were too close. 34 people right next to each other. And yet he complained about our rally, right? Our rallies. Now it’s an honor that so many people showed up because this was going to be a little quickie just to say congratulations because Obama closed the Iron Range and I opened it and a man came up to me, a tough man, a worker, a construction worker, real worker. And he looked at me, this is two years ago, he said, “Sir, you’ve given us back our life.” And he was crying. And I said, “When was the last time you cried?” He said, “I can’t remember.” I said, “You never cried when you were a little baby. You never cried.” This is not a crier. This guy was tough as hell. He said, “Sir, he took our life away.” And let me tell you about Joe. Joe will re-institute that ban in two minutes if we lose. So you better vote for me in Minnesota. Really, I mean honestly. He said, “You gave our lives back. A lot of lives. Thousands of jobs.” And they closed it up. As Vice President Joe Biden wiped out. He wiped out so much, and that includes what he wiped out in the great state of Minnesota. And we’re not going to let it happen anymore. We’re not going to let it happen anymore. Thousands and thousands of workers, we’re not going to let it happen anymore. They were all laid off and now they’re all back. By the way they say, what the hell do I know about iron ore? A lot of steel than a lot of iron over the years. But they say it’s the greatest iron ore anywhere in the world and you should have. After I put tariffs on foreign steel, the Iron Range came roaring back. But the biggest thing I did was knock out his executive order. I’ve knocked out so much in the things that he did. He can’t like me too much. I would say he doesn’t like me too much. Hey, did you see what happened with the FBI today? They caught them cold. Comey either has the worst memory in history. I don’t remember that. Did you spy on President Trump’s campaign? “Gee, I don’t remember that.” “Did you go for a coup? Did you go for a coup?” ” I don’t remember. I don’t know.” I’ll tell you. We caught him cold. It’s about time that something happens. Okay. It’s about time that something happens. It’s enough. We got plenty of information in these crooks, bunch of crooks. A thing like that’s never happened in the history of our country, and it’s about time that something happens. We rescinded the federal withdrawal in Superior National Forest. You’ll know all about that, you people especially, to restore mineral exploration for the iron ore miners in Minnesota. What we’ve done for Minnesota. I lose Minnesota, I’m never coming back. I don’t care. I’m never coming back. We’ve protected Iron Range workers from frivolous lawsuits. That was a big deal. Right? The frivolous lawsuits. We started construction on the Soo Lock to get iron ore to market very quickly. So not only did we open it, we get it to market. We fixed the locks because you couldn’t even get it out. Those things were so old and broken. Now they’re going to be very shortly in perfect shape. I opened up permitting for copper nickel, mining, anybody involved there? It sounded a little far out, but you got a lot of people doing that. I strongly support the replacement of the decaying Line 3 pipeline. We’re going to replace it. It’s all done. It’s all done. All of this is why nine Democrat mayors of cities in the Iron Range have endorsed me over sleepy Joe Biden. Are they here tonight? I don’t know if they’re here tonight. These people are fantastic. Look at these great congressmen. Where are they? Oh, stand up. Wow. We had a ceremony a month ago where I introduced every one of them. I’m not introducing you again. It’s freezing out here. But I want to thank you. You’re great people. Great mayors. I appreciate the support very much. These are Democrats that want to vote for Trump. That endorsed me fully. We’ve done a good job over there. Everything in good shape? Right? Thank you very much. It’s a great honor. If Joe gets in, the radical left will shut down the Iron Range forever. It’s going to be gone. They’re not going to be able to open it again. Not easy to open a thing like that. Not easy. A lot more difficult than people would think. Earlier today, I took another historic step for your state when I signed an executive order, provided billions of dollars to jumpstart production of critical and other minerals, which will create countless jobs that are so important for our country. Minerals. I will always protect the state of Minnesota. I will do that. It’s been very good to me. We almost won it. We almost won it. One more speech. I had a choice. Do I do Michigan, which we won? I should’ve done them both. One more speech. We lost by very little. Think of that though. Hasn’t been won by a Republican. I don’t get that because the Democrats have done such a lousy pathetic job. Hasn’t been one since 1972. Reagan lost. It was the only state he lost. Remember? So we’re going to change that. We’ve got to change it. Who’s going to do what we’ve done for you? Right? Another massive issue for Minnesota is the election of Joe Biden’s plan to inundate your state with a historic flood of refugees. Biden and crazy Bernie Sanders have agreed on a manifesto. Did you see last night? I didn’t agree. I  show and they said, “Oh, actually he did.” Oh, great. They fact checked. They found out he made a mistake. Slight mistake. It’s the worst thing you’ve ever seen. But they pledged a 700% increase in refugees. 700%. Congratulations, Minnesota. Congratulations. And what about Omar where she gets caught harvesting? What the hell is going on? I hope your US attorney is involved. What is going on with Omar? I’ve been reading these reports for two years about how corrupted, crooked she is. Let’s get with it. Let’s get with it. I mean, frankly harvesting is terrible, but it’s the least of the things that she has done. How the hell… Then she tells us how to run our country. Can you believe it? How the hell did Minnesota elect her? What the hell is wrong with you people? Right? What the hell happened? These guys in the… Stand up. Are you a big fan of Omar? I don’t think so. Stand up. Look at this guy. It looks like nobody’s going to fight him. I don’t think you’re a big fan of Omar. Right? No, she’s been crooked for a long time. This is the least of it. It’s time. And you know what? AOC also. It’s time. It’s time. You take a look at the corruption, the disgusting corruption. 700% increase refugees coming from the most dangerous places in the world including Yemen, Syria, and your favorite country, Somalia, right? You love Somalia. This guy loves Somalia. Biden will turn Minnesota into a refugee camp. And he said that. Overwhelming public resources, overcrowding schools, and inundating your hospitals. You know that. It’s already there. It’s a disgrace what they’ve done to your state. It’s a disgrace. Biden has even pledged to terminate our travel ban on jihadist regions, opening the flood gates to radical Islamic terrorism. Remember I used to talk about it all the time? I got a ban. Remember they said he’d never be able to get a ban? And then I lost at the lower court. I lost at the court of appeals. And they said, “He lost, he lost.”  then I won at the Supreme Court. They didn’t even report it. Yeah. They still say, “He lost on the travel ban. He lost, he lost.” But they’re talking about the first two courts. They forget to say that the Supreme court. This is the most . It’s hard to believe actually, but look at all those cameras. That’s a lot. They love it. Every time I’m getting ready, they’ve gotten very good at this, every time I’m getting ready to hit them, the lights just go off. You know those red lights? They go . My administration is keeping terrorists, extremists, and criminals out of our country. And we’re keeping them the hell out of Minnesota. We’ve ended the refugee influx into your state. You were one of the most hard hit states for whatever reason. We’ve ended it. You know that, right? You know that. Does anybody know this? Does anybody know this? I don’t think they tell you about it. But they talk about the suburbs, women in the suburbs. I ended a regulation that nobody would have done. This brings public housing, low-income housing into the suburbs. By the way, just so we can get this right, 30% of the people in the suburbs are low income people. 30% of the people in the suburbs are minorities. So we’re ruining this American dream for everybody, but he’s got a plan. It’s the worst thing you’ve ever seen having to do with zoning. They zone you out. They build low-income housing next to your house. It’s crazy. Then I hear I’m not doing well in the suburbs. I’m not doing well in the suburbs. Are you people crazy? Are you crazy? I just explained this. No, I just explained it. Thank you. No, it’s crazy. And they came to me, great people. Ben Carson, a lot of great people and they came to me and they said, “Sir, why don’t we just amend it?” I said, “No, really, I want it out. I want it over. I want it ended.” Well, it’d be a lot easier to amend it. I said, “No, I want it over. It’s not right. It’s killing your suburbs. And it is. It’s killing your suburbs.” And then they say women in the suburbs don’t like President Trump. I don’t think- “Women in the suburbs don’t like President Trump.” I don’t think so. That happened last time. Remember last time? They said, “He will not do well with women. He will not do well with women. He will not do well with women.” These were the idiots on election night four years ago, “He will not do… This will be a very short night for Donald Trump,” at the time. “This will be a very short,” and at the end they said, “He did really well with women.” It was sort of weird. Anyway, we did well with everybody, actually, and we’re going to do even better now. We have more… Look at this crowd, this was supposed to be a few people. This was supposed to be just a little celebration. I said, “Oh, good. A little celebration.” I figured a couple of hundred people like Sleepy Joe gets it his best day. I said, “How many people?” “About 10,000, Sir.” I said, “Oh, that’s nice.” In just three and a half years, we’ve secured America’s border, rebuilt awesome power of the US military, obliterated the ISIS Caliphate, fixed our disastrous trade deals, and they were a disaster, and brought jobs back home to America. And back home to Minnesota, we brought a lot of jobs back. Last year before the plague came in from China, you had the best year you’ve ever had. The year before that, you had the best year you’ve ever had until the following year, and we’re doing it again, we’re building it up rapidly. China came up, they gave us the plague, it’s no good, we’re never going to forget that. I did a trade deal, the ink wasn’t even dry, and they let that happen. We’re never going to forget it. We built the greatest economy in the history of the world, and now we are quickly doing it again. We’ve added a historic 10.6 million jobs in the last four months. That’s a record the likes of which has never even been close to being challenged. To fight the China virus, we launched the largest national mobilization since world war II, we pioneered lifesaving therapies reducing the fatality rate 85% since April. Think of that, meaning you go to the hospital and you got a lot better chance. I’ll tell you what. I spoke to a gentleman today from Pfizer. I speak to all of these guys, these are great people, and they’re coming up with things that are phenomenal, Regeneron, we are coming up with things that are phenomenal, including therapeutics for therapies. It’s incredible what’s happening. You’ll be seeing it very… And By the way with Biden, it would have been years before you came up with any of this stuff. Years, it would have been years. He complains, “You did not fast enough.” And yet he’s all over the place calling me xenophobic because I closed the border. Okay, how do you figure that one? This guy, just a politician. He’s just another politician. 47 years he hasn’t done a damn thing, but now he’s going to. “I haven’t done anything in 47 years, but now I’m going to.” Europe is almost a 50% greater excess mortality rate than the United States, you don’t hear that. Through Operation Warp Speed, we will develop and distribute a vaccine in record time, it’s going to be very, very soon. And before the end of the year, maybe sooner than that. On November 3rd, Minnesota will decide whether we end this pandemic, defeat the virus, and return to record prosperity. Either way, we’re returning, either way. We’re going to have the vaccine. We’re . Well, whether we allow Joe Biden to kill the recovery… He wants to shut down. This guy says, “Let’s shut it down.” A lot of deaths caused by shutdown; depression, death, drugs, alcoholism, horrendous family fights, horrendous family fights, and he wants to destroy those suburbs by abolishing single family zoning. All of these things are just a horrible thing, what he wants to do. And I think he’s going to do it because he’s not smart enough to understand that the other side has big problems. You know, we did something great. We had the greatest economy in history and we had to close it down because we would have lost millions of lives, and now we’re opening it up and we’re doing it at a level like nobody’s ever seen before, and it’s a great thing, and we’re going to be back in business very soon, except for some Democrats. And they’ll all open up. They’re going to all open up right after November 3rd. They’ll announce, “We’d like to tell you that we’re all opening up November 4th.” Did you see the one group that said, “We’re opening up right after the election, I think we’ll open up.” That’s great. These are terrible people because they’re more interested in politics than they are in the lives of people. They want to confiscate your guns and indoctrinate your children to this poisonous anti-American rhetoric and lies. To combat the toxic left… And you see this, that toxic left-wing propaganda in our schools, we are launching a new pro-American lesson plan for students called the 1776 Commission. We will teach our children the truth about America that we are the most exceptional nation on the face of the earth. That’s what I want them to hear. We are joined tonight by some real warriors, friends of mine. They fight with… they just win, they know how to win. I’m telling you, you have some great ones and they really are, they’re great people. The impeachment hoax, they fought it so great. These are real warriors. I call them warriors. Representatives Tom Emmer, Jim Hagedorn and Pete Stauber, great hockey player. And I’ll tell you, we have some incredible congressional candidates that we’re going to work because we got to get Nancy Pelosi the hell out of there, and we’re very . We have some candidates; Tyler Kistner, where’s Tyler? Thank you, Tyler. Great job. I hear great things, Tyler. A man with the greatest name in politics, Lacy Johnson, great guy, great guy. And somebody who’s going to help us a lot along with Tyler, Lacy, Michelle Fischbach. Thank you Michelle. Thank you. We’re going to be working with you, and they all have my total endorsement, you know that. Okay? The next US Senator from Minnesota is a man who was born for this position unlike your current Senator, who nobody knows who the hell she is. I said, who is she? Is she in the Senate? Jason Lewis. Thank you, Jason. Great job you’re doing. We got to get Jason in, got to get them all in. RNC co-chairman, Tommy Hicks. Thank you, Tommy. And Mike Lindell, he makes more pillows this guy. He makes more pillows, thank you Mike. He goes to a lot of my rallies, he likes these rallies, and we like him. Here as well tonight is 96-year-old world war II veteran, Dr. John . Look at you. You look great, John. Wow. You look good. Handsome. Thank you, John. Thank you very much. It’s an honor, john. After years of rebuilding other nations, we are finally rebuilding our nation. In 2017, I signed a very historic executive order making it difficult and really just looking at what government policy has to do in order to buy American and hire American. You ever see Biden? He’s got a sign, buy American. I said he got it from me. I’ve been doing this for a long time. Copies my campaign, copies our plans. He copies a lot, like you haven’t heard that before. He invested $2.5 trillion in the military, we put 2.5 trillion in. We have the best weapons, all made in the USA. We have the greatest weaponry we’ve ever had. No country has ever come close to the kind of firepower we have. Hope to God we never have to use it. We have firepower and weapons and the Republicans said it because Democrats… We have to have that, otherwise we’re going to be at the mercy of other countries. We have the greatest firepower, the greatest weapons in the history of the world. Hope to God that we never have to use them. And we launched a new branch of the US armed forces, first since the air force in 75 years, it’s called the space force. That’s a big deal. We killed the founder and leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi gone. We took out the world’s number one terrorist, and the murderer of so many American troops and plenty of other troops, Qasem Soleimani is no longer with us. I withdrew from the last administration’s total disaster, the Iran Nuclear Deal. Obama gave them 150 billion. That was bad, but he gave him 1.8 billion in cash. How the hell do you do that? What does 1.8 billion in cash look like? They must have looked at that, they said, “Man, plane loads of cash.” I kept my promise recognized the true capital of Israel, and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. I also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, and instead of endless wars, we are forging peace in the Middle East. And I was nominated for three Nobel Prizes and I didn’t get one story. I have to tell you, because they refuse to write it. When Obama got his Nobel Prize, it was the biggest story I’ve ever seen. And he didn’t even know why he got it. He got it like immediately upon taking office.  but I told my first lady, I told our first lady, “Darling, you’re going to be so proud of me tonight. We’re going to watch television and you’re not going to believe how big this ” “What happened? What happened?” “Darling, I was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize for Israel, Bahrain, United Arab Emirates. And then I was nominated again for Serbia, Kosovo, all different. Then I was nominated a third time.” But I said, “First time, second time, I was a little bit.” Yeah, I know. I love you too. But I said to our First Lady, “Watch this tonight, Darling, it’s going to be.” And I turn to Lester Holt, number two show. I turn to Lester Holt, and they covered one story was about rain, another was about the environment, another was about something else, another, it was a bad hit on me, another one, something else. So now we’re through with about half of it. Now they went to the longest commercial I’ve ever seen. Not supposed to, when you report the fake news, you’re not supposed to get free air time from the US government. Does anybody know what that means? And then they went onto the second half again and again and again, she looked at me, “Darling, I don’t think they’re going to cover this.” I said, “It’s impossible. It’s a nomination for the Nobel Peace award. It’s impossible.” Guess what? It ended, we got nothing. Then three days later we got nothing. And on the third time, the third time I said, “Let’s not even watch. We’re not getting anything. These people are sick.” But I did more in 47 months than sleepy Joe Biden did in 47 years. And now he’s pushing the most far-left platform in history, the Biden plan would destroy social security and destroy protections for people with preexisting conditions, give free federal healthcare to all illegal aliens, bankrupting Medicare. But you know, it’s going to happen. They’re going to pour into our country. When they hear that, they’re going to come in. They’re very smart, very sophisticated, you’d be surprised. Ban school choice and ban all charter schools. No more charter schools, no more school choice. Well, we’re making a lot of progress- There’s no more charter schools, no more school choice but we’re making a lot of progress. In the second term, I will provide school choice to every parent in America. A vote for Republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs, and a limitless future for all Americans. And in conclusion, over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world. And we will end our reliance on China once and for all. Did you see what he said last night about manufacturing? Well, Obama said we’re not going to ever have manufacturing and you’d need a magic wand. Last night he said we’re doing manufacturing. No, no. They gave up on manufacturing. I have almost 700,000 manufacturing jobs. I said, “How can you lose manufacturing?” He’s bad news. They lie. We will make our medical supplies right here in the United States. We will hire more police, increase penalties on assaults. And we will ban deadly sanctuary cities. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech and the right to keep and bear arms. Second amendment. We will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens, and we will keep out, we will keep people out of our country. Thank you. But we will keep out of these ridiculous, endless Wars in countries that you’ve never heard of and you never will hear of. It’s ridiculous. And we’re bringing them all home. You see that. We will maintain America’s unrivaled military might, and we will ensure peace through strength. That’s what we have. Ridiculous. We’re all over the world. We’re in places nobody ever heard of before. We will end surprise medical billing, require price transparency. I’ve already signed it. Can you believe it? It kicks in on January 1st. Can you imagine if this clown gets in? And they’ll say, “He got price transparency. What’s that?” That’ll have such an impact. It kicks in. I said to my people, “You think you could have kicked it in a little bit earlier?” And further reduced health insurance premiums and the cost of prescription drugs, which we’re going to be bringing down massively because of Favorite Nations. We will strongly protect Medicare and social security, and we will always protect those incredible people, as I said, with pre-existing conditions. America will land the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. And it will be soon. You have to see. NASA has become again the greatest space center in the world. You had to see what it looked like when I took over. It was terrible. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools. We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history and always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, In God We Trust. For years, you had a President who apologized for America. Now you have a President who is standing up for America and standing up for the great people of Minnesota. Thank you. But if we don’t win, I’m never calling you great again. So get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, and get you co-workers and get out and vote. We got to win. We got to win. Early voting has already begun. Don’t wait. Please go out and vote. Did you see in New York today? A hundred thousand fraudulent ballots. They send out a hundred thousand ballots. Wrong names, wrong addresses, wrong envelopes. Other than that, that did quite well. Think of it, a hundred thousand. So you know what this solution? That’s okay. We’ll send out another a hundred thousand. I said, “Really? What’s going to happen to the first hundred thousand. Who’s going to vote them?” This is crazy what’s going on. This is crazy. From St. Paul to St. Cloud, from Minneapolis to Minnetonka, and from Rochester to right here in Duluth. I like Duluth. This great state was pioneered by men and women who brave the wilderness and the winters to build a better life for themselves and for their families. They were truly brave, brilliant, incredible people. They were tough and they were strong. They didn’t have a lot of money. They didn’t have a lot of luxury, but they had grit, they had faith and they had each other. They were miners and lumberjacks, fishermen and farmers, shipbuilders and shopkeepers, but they all had one thing in common. They loved their families, they loved their country and they loved their God. Proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working. We’re going to keep on fighting. And we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. It’s true. We’re to keep on winning. You know, Minnesota, maybe I’ll just do a  because we need Jason. Jason. Where’s Jason? Jason’s going to come. Jason Lewis. He’s going to be your Senator. You’re going to win so much. You know that one, right? You’ve heard it. Should I do it or not? I’ve got this beautiful crescendo of a speech and now I have to ruin it with this story with Jason, but let’s do it anyway. But we’re going to win so much because Minnesota before I came around was not doing too well. Okay? Was not doing too well. Then you had your best years ever. But we’re going to win so much and you’re going to go and see your great Senator, Jason Lewis. He’s going to say. And you’re going to see Emmer, and you’re going to see all of that. And you’re going to say, Mr. Senator, please go see the President. We’re winning too much. We can’t stand it, sir. Minnesota, we’re not used to winning this much. It’s too much, sir. Please, go see. Well, I don’t want to do that. Please Senator. Go see the President. We’re winning too much. We cannot stand it. For years we’ve done poorly before he came along. Now we’re doing so well. And we’re growing now stronger than ever before. We don’t want to win so much, Mr. Senator. So your Senator is going to come in. “Hi Jason, how are you doing?” “Sir, Minnesota is winning too much. We have to stop it.” I said, “What are you talking about?” “Sir, we have to stop it. It’s just too much running. We have to stop it.” I say, “Jason, let me tell you. I know the people of Minnesota and they love winning. They’re going to keep winning. We’re going to win. We’re going to win so much. We’re going to keep on winning. And you’re going to have the greatest year that you’ve ever had next year and the year after. And that’s where it’s heading. So I just want to thank you, and Jason, I’m sorry. I will not follow your wish.” Thank you very much. But we are. We’re one movement. We’re one family. We’re one beautiful people in one glorious nation under God and together with the incredible people of Minnesota, we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you, Minnesota. Go out and vote. (singing) If you look at what he did, he was probably, or possibly losing that coherence that everybody talks about, because he’s a mess. Let’s face it. He’s a mess. Now I could have waited, but he was saying so many lies that I figured it was just better to bring it up as he’s saying them, because it was just lie after lie, after lie. And so I’d do it as he said it, I would criticize him. And I think it was effective. If you look at the polls, I mean, almost all the polls, the poll people, the polls say that I won. The Hispanics, they had me close to 70% at 28 because they’re strong people, smart people. I mean, I would have preferred letting him catch himself because he can’t issue a full statement practically, but at the same time, on the assumption that he does, he’s going on and on with lie after lie, so I had to correct those lies as they came up. Too many to go back and get. We didn’t have enough paper. Too many to go and get. And I don’t know. I think it was very effective. Frankly, I’d like to leave the same format. I like the format. Well, this is the rules that were agreed to, but I think it would be very bad. Do you remember with Hillary Clinton, they had modulated my mic, and they actually apologized for it, but they modulated my mic. So when I looked at her, they had my mic turned off or way down, and I said, “What’s going on over here?” They actually issued an apology. So we’re dealing with very tricky people here, but I think you remember that very well. They modulated my mic and they say I won all of the debates. So I was in 16, 17 debates. They say I won all of the debates. I like this format, but at the same time, he’s got got to be truthful. And by the way, a number of people brought up today, Sean, that he was the one that interrupted me. He started off with three major interruptions long before I started doing it to him. Well, I went after him on that and I said, “Are you going to stack the Court?” I also said, “Are you going to say the words law and order?” He wouldn’t say them. He then said, “Law and order with safety and justice,” or something. But I said to him that, but we need law and order in our country. And the Democrats cities are falling to pieces with these people running them. But stacking the courts. They can have many justices. They want to put many because we’ve been beating them, and we have the nine justices and we have a great new one going on. But now what they want to do is they want to put many additional justices on the Supreme Court. It’s sort of like you’re losing the game and you start cheating. They are. I mean, they’re doing it with the ballots, they’re doing it with the Supreme Court, and it’s a very sad thing. But they are, they are looking to stack the court. And they are also going to add two or three new states. I heard Guam and two others that you mentioned, as you know. That would give them six automatic Senate seats, automatic, no chance. It would be very unfair. And 20 something congressional seats. So that’s what they want to do. So if you give them what they want, we really have a one-party system. We can never catch up. So they’ll be talking about anywhere from four to six senators. Republicans can’t win those states, although I’ve been better to Puerto Rico than any other president. I’ve given them a lot of help. But if you take a look at what’s happening, they’re not good to Puerto Rico, but I’ve been good to Puerto Rico. I have a great relationship to Puerto Rico. But they’re looking for statehood. A lot of Puerto Ricans don’t want statehood. They’re doing better the way it has now, frankly. And you’ve been seeing this. This has been taking place. They want to put two or three states. So they want to have 53, right? 53. What’s the flag going to look like? Right, Sean? What’s the flag going to look like? They want to have 53 or 52? Depending on what they do, I guess they could probably do even more than that. We have islands all over the place. What don’t they go for the whole ball game? So it’s a very, very sad thing for our country. Very, very sad thing. And in all fairness to Mitch, he did not want to do the nuclear option. And I disagreed because I said, “They’re going to do it.” It turned out that they are, but he’s a legitimate guy. He wasn’t going to do the nuclear option because he thought it was bad for our country. So I understood that. I didn’t go wild. But I did say, “It would be good to do it because they’re going to do it.” So it’s a very sad thing. So you’re going to have two or three more states added. You’re going to have four or six senators added, 100% Democrat, 100%. You’re going to have maybe 20 congressional candidates or districts added. And it’s really a horrible thing. It’s going to be very unfair. You’re going to end up having a one-party system in the United States. So if people want to stop that you got to vote against the Democrats. So she did test positive. I just heard about this. She tested positive. She’s a hard worker, a lot of masks. So she wears masks a lot, but she tested positive, and I just went out with a test, because we spend a lot of time and the first lady just went out with a test also. So whether we quarantine or whether we have it, I don’t know. It’s very hard when you’re with soldiers, when you’re with airman, you’re with the Marines and the police officers, I’m with them so much. And when they come over to you it’s very hard to say, “Stay back, stay back.” It’s a tough kind of a situation. It’s a terrible thing. So I just went for a test and we’ll see what happens. I mean, who knows? But you know Hope very well. She’s fantastic and she’s done a great job. But it’s very, very hard when you are with people from the military or from law enforcement and they come over to you and they want to hug you and they want to kiss you because we really have done a good job for them. And you get close and things happen. I was surprised to hear with Hope, but she’s a very warm person with them, and she knows there’s a risk, but she’s young. And I just went out for a test. They just do it. It’ll come back later, I guess. And the first lady also, because we spend a lot of time with Hope and others. So we’ll see what happens, but you have to treat our people great. You can’t just say, “Stay away, stay away.” They come up to you. They have such love with what we’ve done for them. And there’s such love and you have to treat our people great. I think the vaccines are coming quickly. I do think it’s somewhat political. They’d like to do it, even the drug companies, they’ve dealt with these people a long time. I think they’d like to do it after the election, even if it’s a couple of days, but the fact is, the vaccines are coming out. The therapeutics are coming out, and they’re coming out really good. Regeneron and others, other companies, are great, Eli Lilly. And so, we’ll have to see. The survival rate is so much better now than it was. You’ve seen those numbers. I guess 95% or something like that, better. So we’ll have to see. I mean, I’ll get my test back either tonight or tomorrow morning, but I spend a lot of time with Hope and so does the first lady, and she’s tremendous. I was a little surprised, but she’s a very warm person. She has a hard time when soldiers and law enforcement comes up to her. She wants to treat them great, not say, “Stay away. I can’t get near you.” It’s a very, very tough disease. A scam and everyone knows it, Sean. It’s a scam and everyone knows it. Well, in New York they last 100,000 ballots were sent out wrong. The envelopes were wrong, the names were wrong, everything was wrong. So they said, “Oh, that’s okay. We’ll send out a new 100,000.” Okay, let’s assume they get it right. What happens to 100,000 that they sent out? They’re going to be sent back by somebody and it’s going to be a fraud. This is a terrible thing that’s happening to our country. And the only one that knows it better than you and I and other people is the Democrats. They know it, they know it. They’re smart. But I’ll tell you the big hope is that we have great federal judges. And we have a lot of cases in front of these federal judges. And I think they’re really talented, very smart. And I think that we’re going to do very well. How about this? The election ends on November 3rd, but they’re giving certain states the right to go another week. So that means we’re not going to know, because they’re big states, that means we’re not going to know the election for another week. Just take a look at New York. Take a look at the one city, the ballots that were thrown into a garbage can and they all had the Trump name on it. They were military ballots. They were thrown into a garbage can. The ones that were on a tray and they were thrown into a creek or river, it’s a terrible thing. And if you look at Carolyn Maloney, what they did to that guy that ran against her is a disgrace. That’s in New York, and that’s only for a congressional race. They have no idea where the votes are, where the ballots are. This is going to be all over. This is in Virginia. This is in New Jersey. It’s a very, very sad thing. And hopefully we can win by a lot because I have no doubt that they’re going to be doing a number. I have no doubt about it. And the press knows that too. They act so sacrosanct. They act so, “Oh, it’s so terrible. He’s talking about our democracy.” They know what’s going on. It’s really a shame. If the other side did this, you would see everybody would be arrested, put in jail. You have to see what’s going on. But the good news is we just got a very good decision in Rhode Island, great decision. We have some great decisions coming down. You have to have the votes in by November 3rd. You have to have it signed. You have to have it certified. They have to guarantee the certification. I mean, in Nevada, Sean, they don’t want to have any certification of a signature, just do a signature and they don’t want to have certification. I think you don’t even have to sign it. And the governor is a very political person. It’s a ridiculous thing. And we’re going to win Nevada on a fair basis, but it’s very hard when they send millions of ballots out and then they cheat. Well, it’s a scam. They spied on our campaign. They got caught. The only sad thing is nothing’s happening with them and their a bunch of crooks. They spied on our campaign. They got caught. They tried to do a coup and they got caught. Now we get to see what’s going to happen. It’s time to move. This is ridiculous, okay? This is ridiculous. It’s so sad. We caught them spying on our campaign. Never happened before. Spied before and after, and it never happened before. And I watched Comey. He couldn’t remember anything, but he’s writing all these books. They’re guilty as hell. They should all be in jail, okay? You know it and I know it. They should all be in jail and it’s disgraceful. It’s a disgrace to our country if they don’t go to jail. Hillary Clinton got caught, Comey got caught, they all got caught. And Biden, by the way, mentioned the Logan Act. That was a big part of it, and Obama too. It’s a disgrace what’s happened, a disgrace. And they should do something about it. They can’t let this just go on ad infinitum. They should do something about it. Well, it is. I mean, it is, but we’ve already rebuilt the military, two and a half trillion dollars. It’s the strongest military in the world by far. We have weapons the likes of which nobody even comes close to. And so we’ve done that. We’ve cut taxes at a record level. If you look at regulations, we’ve cut more regulations than any president in history by far. Well, I think better than that. I think you’re going to see some great numbers just two days before, because you’re going to have the third quarter come out just before the election, and I think you’re going to be up anywhere from 22 to 35% in GDP. And if that’s the case, that’s bigger than any economic rebound in history. So I think that’ll be good. Let’s see what happens, but those numbers are coming out sometime prior to November 3rd, which is the election. Thank you very much, Sean. Thank you. I want to begin by thanking all of the incredible medical professionals, the doctors, the nurses, everybody at Walter Reed Medical Center, I think it’s the finest in the world, for the incredible job they’ve been doing. I came here, wasn’t feeling so well. I feel much better now. We’re working hard to get me all the way back. I have to be back, because we still have to make America great again. We’ve done an awfully good job of that, but we still have steps to go, and we have to finish that job, and I’ll be back. I think I’ll be back soon, and I look forward to finishing up the campaign the way it was started, and the way we’ve been doing, and the kind of numbers that we’ve been doing. We’ve been so proud of it, but this was something that happened, and it’s happened to millions of people all over the world, and I’m fighting for them. Not just in the US. I’m fighting for them all over the world. We’re going to beat this coronavirus, or whatever you want to call it, and we’re going to beat it soundly. So many things have happened. If you look at the therapeutics, which I’m taking right now, some of them, and others are coming out soon that are looking like, frankly, they’re miracles, if you want to know the truth. They’re miracles. People criticize me when I say that, but we have things happening that look like they’re miracles coming down from God, so I just want to tell you that I’m starting to feel good. You don’t know over the next period of a few days, I guess that’s the real test, so we’ll be seeing what happens over those next couple of days. I just want to be so thankful for all of the support I’ve seen, whether it’s on television, or reading about it. I most of all appreciate what’s been said by the American people, by almost a bipartisan consensus of American people. It’s a beautiful thing to see, and I very much appreciate it, and I won’t forget it. I promise you that. I also want to thank the leaders of the world for their condolences, and they know what we’re going through. They know what, as your leader, what I have to go through, but I had no choice, because I just didn’t want to stay in the White House. I was given that alternative. Stay in the White House, lock yourself in. Don’t ever leave. Don’t even go to the Oval Office. Just stay upstairs, and enjoy it. Don’t see people. Don’t talk to people, and just be done with it, and I can’t do that. I had to be out front, and this is America. This is the United States. This is the greatest country in the world. This is the most powerful country in the world. I can’t be locked up in a room upstairs, and totally safe, and just say, “Hey, whatever happens, happens.” I can’t do that. We have to confront problems. As a leader, you have to confront problems. There’s never been a great leader that would have done that, so that’s where it is. I’m doing well. I want to thank everybody. Our first lady is doing very well. Melania asked me to say something as to the respect that she has for our country, the love that she has for our country, and we’re both doing well. Melania is really handling it very nicely, as you’ve probably read. She’s slightly younger than me, just a little tiny bit, and therefore just … We know the disease. We know the situation with age versus younger people, and Melania is handling it, statistically, like it’s supposed to be handled, and that makes me very happy, and it makes the country very happy, but I’m also doing well, and I think we’re going to have a very good result. Again, over the next few days, we’re going to probably know for sure, so I just want to thank everybody out there, everybody all over the world, specifically the United States. The outpouring of love has been incredible. I will never forget. Thank you very much. We’re getting great reports from the doctors. This is an incredible hospital, Walter Reed. The work they do is just absolutely amazing. And I want to thank them all. The nurses, the doctors, everybody here. I’ve also gotten to meet some of the soldiers and the first responders, and what a group. I also think we’re going to pay a little surprise to some of the great patriots that we have out on the street. And they’ve been out there for a long time, and they’ve got Trump flags. And they love our country. So I’m not telling anybody, but you. But I’m about to make a little surprise visit. So perhaps I’ll get there before you get to see me. But when I look at the enthusiasm, and we have enthusiasm like probably nobody’s ever had. Our people that love the job we’re doing. We have more enthusiasm than maybe anybody. So it’s been a very interesting journey. I learned a lot about COVID. I learned it by really going to school. This is the real school. This isn’t the “let’s read the book” school. And I get it. And I understand it. And it’s a very interesting thing. And I’m going to be letting you know about it. In the meantime, we love the USA, and we love what’s happening. Thank you. I just left Walter Reed Medical Center, and it’s really something very special. The doctors, the nurses, the first responders, and I learned so much about coronavirus. One thing that’s for certain, don’t let it dominate you. Don’t be afraid of it. You’re going to beat it. We have the best medical equipment. We have the best medicines all developed recently, and you’re going to beat it. I went … I didn’t feel so good. And two days ago, I could have left two days ago. Two days ago, I felt great. Like, better than I have in a long time. I said just recently … better than 20 years ago. Don’t let it dominate. Don’t let it take over your lives. Don’t let that happen. We have the greatest country in the world. We’re going back. We’re going back to work. We’re going to be out front. As your leader, I had to do that. I knew there’s danger to it, but I had to do it. I stood out front. I led. Nobody that’s a leader would not do what I did. And I know there’s a risk. There’s a danger. But that’s okay, and now I’m better. Maybe I’m immune. I don’t know. But don’t let it dominate your lives. Get out there. Be careful. We have the best medicines in the world, and they’re all happened very shortly, and they’re all getting approved. And the vaccines are coming momentarily. Thank you very much. And Walter Reed, what a group of people. Thank you very much. Hi, perhaps you recognize me? It’s your favorite president. And I’m standing in front of the Oval Office at the White House, which is always an exciting place to be. I got back a day ago from Walter Reed Medical Center. I spent four days there, and didn’t have to, I could’ve stayed at the White House, but the doctors said, “Because you’re president, let’s do it.” I said, “Fine. You tell me what to do, and I’m going to listen.” These are great professionals. They’ve done a fantastic job. And by the way, not only at Walter Reed, all over the country, we have the greatest doctors in the world, we have the greatest nurses, the greatest first responders, law enforcement, by the way, incredible, firefighters, everybody. They’re just great. We have great people. This is a great country. But I spent four days there and I went in and I wasn’t feeling so hot, and within a very short period of time, they gave me Regeneron. It’s called Regeneron, and other things too. But I think this was the key, but they gave me Regeneron, and it was like, unbelievable. I felt good immediately. I felt as good three days ago as I do now. So I just want to say, we have Regeneron. We have a very similar drug from Eli Lilly and they’re coming out and we’re trying to get them on an emergency basis. We’ve authorized it. I’ve authorized it. If you’re in the hospital and you’re feeling really bad, I think we’re going to work it so that you get them and you’re going to get them free, and especially if you’re a senior, we’re going to get you in there quick. We have hundreds of thousands of doses that are just about ready. I have emergency use authorization, all set, and we got to get it signed now, and you’re going to get better. You’re going to get better, really fast. This is things that nobody even thought of a few months ago. The job that the scientists, the labs, everybody has done is incredible. Then in addition to that, you have various other drugs that help a lot. But I view these, I know they call them therapeutic, but to me it wasn’t therapeutic, it just made me better. I call that a cure. So I want to get these things done. So we have to get them done. We have to get them approved, and I want to get them to the hospitals where people are feeling badly. That’s much more important to me than the vaccine. But on the vaccines, we have many companies that are in final stages for the vaccines, Johnson & Johnson. Moderna, Pfizer, all great companies, but many of them, and we’re going to have a great vaccine very, very shortly. I think we should have it before the election, but frankly, the politics gets involved and that’s okay, they want to play their games. It’s going to be right after the election, but we did it. Nobody else, nobody else would have been able to do it. The FDA has acted as quickly as they’ve ever acted in history. There’s never been a time and no president has ever pushed him like I pushed them either, to be honest with you. But the FDA is approving things in a matter of weeks, that used to take a matter of years. So we have these drugs, Eli Lilly, and the others that are so good. But they are, in my opinion, remember this, they’re going to say that they’re, “Therapeutic.” And I guess they are therapeutic. Some people don’t know how to define therapeutic. I view it different, it’s a cure. For me, I walked in, I didn’t feel good. A short 24 hours later, I was feeling great, I wanted to get out of the hospital and that’s what I want for everybody. I want everybody to be given the same treatment as your president because I feel great. I feel like perfect. So I think this was a blessing from God that I caught it. This was a blessing in disguise. I caught it. I heard about this drug. I said, “Let me take it.” It was my suggestion. I said, “Let me take it,” and it was incredible the way it worked. Incredible. I think if I didn’t catch it, we’d be looking at that like a number of other drugs, but it really did a fantastic job. I want to get for you what I got and I’m going to make it free. You’re not going to pay for it. It wasn’t your fault that this happened. It was China’s fault, and China is going to pay a big price for what they’ve done to this country. China is going to pay a big price for what they’ve done to the world. This was China’s fault, and just remember that. So we’re going to get you the drug. It’s going to be free. We’re going to get it into the hospitals as soon as you can, as soon as we can. And you’ll see some amazing things happen because we have … our military is doing the distribution. It’s called logistics, and they deliver, hundreds of thousands of troops in a matter of days. This is easy stuff for them. Our generals are all ready, we’re waiting for the emergency use authorization and the drug companies have just made a lot of it. So hopefully this is going to be not just a therapeutic, it’s going to be much more than a therapeutic. You’re going to get better. You’re going to get better fast, just like I did. So again, a blessing in disguise. Good luck. Thank you. Well, thank you very much and keep that enthusiasm going, get out and vote. We got to vote. We got to vote these people into oblivion, vote them into oblivion. Got to get rid of them so bad for our country. First of all, I’m feeling great. I don’t know about you. How’s everyone feeling? Good? And I’m honored to welcome, we call this a peaceful protest to the White House in support of the incredible men and women of law enforcement and all of the people that work so well with us. I have to tell you our black community, our Hispanic community, thank you very much. Thank you. But before going any further, I want to thank all of you for your prayers. I know you’ve been praying and I was in that hospital. I was watching down over so many people and I went out to say hello to those people. And I took a little heat for it, but I’d do it again. And let me tell you, I’d do it again. On behalf of myself and the First Lady, this has been really an incredible outpouring and we’re starting very, very big with our rallies and with our everything, because we cannot allow our country to become a socialist nation. We cannot let that happen. And that’s what would happen or worse, by the way or worse. I want you to know our nation’s going to defeat this terrible China virus, as we call it and we’re producing powerful therapies and drugs and we’re healing the sick and we’re going to recover. And the vaccine is coming out very, very quickly in record time. As you know, it’s coming out very, very soon. We have great, great companies doing it and there’ll be distributing it. And we will through our military very, very rapidly, through the power of the American spirit, I think more than anything else, science medicine will eradicate the China virus once and for all. We’ll get rid of it all over the world. You see big flare ups in Europe, big flare ups in Canada, very big flare up in Canada, you saw that today. A lot of flare ups, but it’s going to disappear. It is disappearing and with vaccines are going to help and the therapeutics are going to help a lot. I just want to thank everyone this afternoon. What beautiful colors. Where did you get that color Candace? Where did that come from? What a beautiful color. I want to get one of them. I want to put one of them on instead of a white shirt. I want to thank you though, seriously. Every day, more black and Latino Americans are leaving behind left wing politicians and their failed ideology. It’s what they are. They failed for many years and many, many decades. Democrats have run nearly every inner city in America and I mean, for 100 years and their policies have delivered nothing but calamity, poverty and trouble. Sleepy Joe Biden has betrayed black and Latino Americans. If you think he can run this country, you’re wrong. For half a century, shipping your jobs to China, that’s what they’ve been doing. We’re bringing the jobs back. We’ve been bringing them back. We’ve been charging China a lot of money too, with the tariffs, a lot of money, billions and billions of dollars. Opening your borders to mass illegal immigration. The wall is now 380 miles long. It’ll soon be finished. Trapping us in endless foreign wars, these ridiculous foreign wars that lasts for 19 years, our people are coming back home you know that. And selling you out to the rich global as Wall Street donors, they have the Wall Street donors. They want the Wall Street donors. Someday somebody is going to have to write a little story about that. Black and Latino Americans are rejecting the radical socialists left and they’re embracing our pro jobs, pro worker, pro-police. We want law and order. We have to have law and order and pro-American agenda. I want to thank the Blexit Foundation for organizing this event. Thank you very much. Thank you. And especially your two founders, two friends of mine, great people, Candace Owens and former Tucson police officer, Brandon Tatum. Thank you, both. Great job. What a great job. Two really brilliant, smart young people. Great. And thank you very much for being here. We really appreciate it. So you’ve just marched to the White House because you understand to protect the lives of black Americans and all Americans, you have to have your police support you. You have to have that. If the left gains power, they’ll launch a nationwide crusade against law enforcement, and they’ve already done that. And you see them. They’re doing that at a level that nobody’s ever seen before. The other day in the debate Biden couldn’t even use the words law enforcement. I said, “Say law enforcement. Say law enforcement,” and he was bailed out by the anchor. Then I said, very simply I said, “Name one law enforcement group that’s supporting you,” he couldn’t do it, but he was bailed out by the anchor. Second time bailed. He got bailed out by that anchor a lot. Taking their funds away, their firearms, their fundamental authorities, taking everything away, including your freedom. Joe Biden even said, “When you call 911, a therapist should answer the call.” That doesn’t work. That doesn’t work. But this is the people telling him what, because he doesn’t say, he’s told what to say. You saw what they introduced today. They’ve gone through a period of years. No fracking, no fracking, no fracking. All of a sudden gets a nomination, he says, “There’s got to be fracking.” For Pennsylvania, Oklahoma, Texas, North Dakota, all of you, there will be if it happens, all of those jobs are gone. Your energy jobs are gone if they get in. Just remember I said it. Just to remember. I don’t think so either. And I have to say ,there’s been more enthusiasm. We have had more enthusiasm right now, right now this year than we had four years ago by a factor of three times. And we had a lot and they had none. They have no enthusiasm. They have no enthusiasm. In fact, the gap is so incredible and a poll just came out, I think it said 56% of the people prefer their position now in the midst of a pandemic than they did four years ago. Think of what that means. 56. And it’s a Gallup poll and it’s the highest poll ever recorded. 56%. Now tell me about that. No, we had it going and we really had it going and then the plague came in from China but we’re getting rid of that and we’re rebuilding it and it’s going to be better than it was even before. But the homes and churches and businesses of black and Hispanic Americans have been looted, you know that. They’ve been vandalized and burned by left wing fanatics, total bad people. They know what they’re doing, yet Biden likes to call them peaceful protesters. You see people, you see anchors from a couple of the very bad, very corrupt networks standing and behind them, the cities are burning and they’re saying, “This is a peaceful protest,” and you look, and everything’s on fire. I want to thank our law enforcement and I want to thank everybody in the community, in the community drives that are working with law enforcement. I want to thank them. I think we have the support of every law enforcement group in this country practically. I don’t know of any that I don’t. Maybe there must be some, there must be one. They’ll find one tonight. They’ll say, “No, he misrepresented.” But we have a level of support the likes of which nobody’s I don’t think ever seen before. I don’t think so. And you’re going to see that. Do you see how many crooked ballots are being found and turned back in and fraudulent? Just what I said. Then they’ll say, “He doesn’t believe in freedom.” I totally believe in freedom. That’s called freedom. What we’re doing is freedom. Tremendous problems with the ballots. 50,000 in Ohio, 25,000… You have to see it. I mean, every day there’s a story about ballots. Some thrown out that happen to have the name Trump, military ballots were thrown out with the name Trump on them. But I think we’re going to swamp them by so much. Hopefully, it’s not going to matter. And we have law enforcement watching. We have law enforcement watching all those ballots, they’re being found for a reason. Left wing politicians like Kamala Harris who really did not do very well the other night. By the way, did our Vice-President do a good job, Candace? That was easy for him. No, he did a great job because we’re in the side of right. We really are. We’re on the side of right. And by the way we are, and it’s true and I say it and I say it all the time now, more and more, we are draining the swamp like nobody in history has ever drained the swamp. Nobody in history has ever drained. We’re here today to deliver a united message to police officers all across our great land that are American. And I mean every American, every race and color, we love you. Every race, color, creed, we support you. We honor you. It’s a dangerous profession. They’ve been doing an incredible job and I just want to thank them on behalf of everybody here today, because that’s why we’re safe. In contrast, the Democrat’s socialist program and platform, and it really is more than socialist. It’s not just socialist, it’s beyond socialism. He says, “Communist.” Yeah, that’s about right. But I recently announced my plan to deliver more opportunities, security, fairness, and prosperity to the black community, to the Hispanic community. And you know what it is. I don’t have to go over it, but it’s the Platinum Plan. And it’s going to bring back new jobs, like at a level that you’ve never seen before. And we’ve done a lot. We’ve done a lot, but increase capital. It’s going to increase money coming into the black community, to the Hispanic community where it’s been very much shut out, in advance, very much home ownership and wealth building. And it’s already taking place and it’s taking place at a level, and had we not been hit by the pandemic, you would have seen numbers like you’ve never seen before, but those numbers are already rebuilding again. We’re going to build up a peaceful and safer neighborhood program like you haven’t seen with the highest standards of policing, we’ll create a healthcare system that delivers better care at a lower cost. Obamacare is a disaster. We want to terminate it. We want to get great healthcare. And that’s what we’re doing. Great healthcare. And we’ll always take care of pre-existing conditions, always. And I think we’re at a point where we’re getting and right now if you look at what we’ve done in healthcare, people don’t talk about it. We’ve done an incredible job. Less expensive healthcare… Much better healthcare at a much less expensive price. You can’t do better than that. And it’s happening and it’s happening fast. Another thing is school choice. You have to have school choice. Charter schools, school choice. So I make this statement every once in a while and people think it’s a little bit in the bull side but we’ve achieved a historic reduction of violent crime, we signed a landmark criminal justice reform bill that nobody thought was possible to even think about. I did that. I did that. I got that done. And I worked with a lot of people, but we got it done. The Obama administration couldn’t get it done. Biden couldn’t even think about it. He doesn’t even know what it is. We have prison reform. We achieved the lowest black and Hispanic unemployment rate in the history of our country. The black youth unemployment rate reached the lowest ever again in the history of our country. And last year, black and Hispanic American poverty reached the lowest ever in the history of our country. It’s all building back up so quickly. And if you look at what we’ve done with criminal justice reform, if you look at what we’ve done with historically black colleges and universities, where we funded them, they couldn’t get funded. Nobody was funding that for years and years and decades, nobody was funding them. And if you look at what we’ve done with Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, Opportunity Zones and the jobs created. And I’ve said it very strongly and perhaps, I don’t know, criminal justice reform, people say, maybe that’s the best of all but the fact is they’re all great. Every one of them is great. And I say, the fact is that I’ve done more for the black community than any president since Abraham Lincoln. I say it. Nobody can dispute it. Nobody can dispute it, it’s true. Nobody can dispute it. So we are now beginning the fastest economic recovery in history. We created a record 11.4 million jobs just in the last four months. That’s the fastest ever. The US has seen the smallest economic contraction of any major nation anywhere in the world. So we’ve seen the smallest going down. If you look at it, that’s an incredible statement. Our opponents will crush the comeback with unscientific lockdowns. They want to lock everything down. Here we go again. They want to lock it down. We’re not going to let it happened. We’re not going to let it happen. So important you get out and vote. You got to get out and vote. We got a great poll in Florida. Got a great poll in North Carolina. Got a great poll in Arizona. Got a great poll in Nevada, actually. Just got a great poll in Nevada. I think we’re doing really well. I mean, this is in addition to states that we’re going to win. Georgia is looking fantastic. Texas is looking for fantastic. Well, think about Texas, they have no oil, they don’t want oil. They don’t want guns. They don’t want religion. I don’t think you’re going to win Texas very well. Now, we’ve got a great poll in Texas. We’re getting great polls all over the place and they understand it. It’s driving them crazy. And you know why though? And Candace, it is. It’s because of the spirit. There’s a spirit the likes of which this country hasn’t seen in a very, very long time. So I just want to thank you all for being on the White House lawn and this beautiful great lawn and I’m very proud of this country. I’m very, very proud. I want to thank all of the doctors and labs and scientists and all of the people that are working so hard because we’re way ahead of everybody. But I just want to thank most particularly you because you people come out and you come out and you cheer and you love your country and you get it. You’re way, way ahead, of many, many people in this country, but the country is getting it. The country is seeing something now. Thank you. I love you too. The people of our country and the whole world is watching, are seeing things now that they haven’t seen in this country for decades. They’re seeing a spirit and a resilience like they haven’t seen. I just want to thank you and get out and vote. We got to make this bigger than even four years ago. It’s more important. This is the most important election we’ve ever had. This is more important than even four years ago. I used to say the most important and it was true at the time. This is the single most important election in the history of our country. Get out and vote. And I love you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you, Candace. Thank you. Thank you . Hello everybody. Hello Orlando. Hello Sanford. It’s great to be with you. Thank you. It’s great to be back. That’s a lot of people. Our competitor sleepy Joe, he had a rally today and practically nobody showed up. I don’t know what’s going on. Sleepy Joe. But it’s great to be back in my home state, Florida to make my official return to the campaign trail. I am so energized by your prayers and humbled by your support. We’ve had such incredible support and here we are. Here we are. But we’re going to finish. We’re going to make this country greater than ever before. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. We’ve made tremendous progress. If you look at what we’re doing with therapeutics and frankly cures, we’ve made tremendous progress. And I said to my people, we are going to take whatever the hell they gave me and we’re going to distribute it around to hospitals and everyone’s going to have the same damn thing. We’ve all endured a lot together. And we are doing better by far than we ever did in 2016. The enthusiasm’s greater. The spirit is greater. We’re going to have, if it’s possible, an even greater and more important victory than we had just four years ago. And nobody ever said this fight was not going to be a hard one, but we will make it like you’ve never seen before. We are more successful now than we’ve ever been before. Our military is rebuilt. Take a look at what’s going on with our economy. I hate to say to the fake news, we’re about to hit another stock market record, 401Ks. Sleepy Joe Biden. Not a nice guy, by the way. I have to be honest. He’s not a nice guy. People say, “Oh, he’s such a nice guy.” He had a very bad day today. He had a very bad day. You saw what happened. If I ever had a day like he had today, they’d say it’s over. It’s over. No Biden had a bad day. He forgot Mitt Romney’s name. He didn’t know what state he was in. And he said today he’s a proud Democrat running for the US Senate. No you can’t. Can’t do it. It’s the second time. Can you imagine if I did that? “It’s great to be with you. It’s great to be a wonderful developer from New York.” They’d say he’s out of here. Get him out. No, Biden had a bad day. He’s got a lot of bad days coming. Look, look, we can’t play games. The one thing I know for sure, President Xi of China did us no favor. President Putin of Russia, you’re looking around. Kim Jong-un, whatever happened to the war we were supposed to be in with Kim Jong-un. Kim Jong-un, they’re 100% sharp. We have somebody running who’s not 100%. He’s not 80%. He’s not 60%. We can’t have this as a country. We can’t have it. Joe Biden is also owned by the radical globalists, the wealthy donors, the big money special interests who shipped away your jobs, shut down your factories, threw open your borders and ravaged our cities while sacrificing American blood and treasure in this ridiculous, endless wars. Set of endless wars that we’ve been in for a long time. 19 years, they’re all coming back home. You know that, right? They’re all coming back home. Our great warriors, our great soldiers. The corrupt political class is desperate to regain their power by any means necessary. We’re the one standing in their way. We’re the one standing up for the American worker, the American family, and for the American dream. And that’s what we’re doing on this beautiful evening. This beautiful evening in Florida. Oh do I like Florida. Did we win Florida last time? Was that beautiful? Everything I hear, we’re winning by a lot. Then you turn on the fake news. They say, “The polls are tied in Florida.” I don’t get it. I don’t. We heard the same thing last year. Remember? Four years ago, we heard the same thing. ” We’re going to lose Florida,” they said four years ago, “by five points.” They called that thing so early in the evening and we won by a lot. And we’re winning by a lot more now than we were four years ago. 22 days from now, we’re going to win this state. We’re going to win four more years in the White House. We’re going to make our country greater than it has ever been before. Thank you, man. Thank you. This is the most important election in the history of our country. And I used to say it in 2016. I’m sorry, at the time I thought it was. These people are crazy. We have to win. Most important we’ve ever had. Biden has made a corrupt bargain exchange for his party’s nomination. He’s handed control to the socialists, the Marxists and the left-wing extremists. And you know that. And he’s got no strength left. He’s got no power left. He’s got nothing going. If he wins, the radical left will be running the country and they’re addicted to power and God help us if they ever got it, because we would never have the same country again. And you couldn’t make a comeback. You don’t make comebacks from where they’d take us. If I do not sound like a typical Washington politician, it’s because frankly, I’m not a politician. I’m embarrassed by the throne. And if I don’t always play by the rules of Washington establishment, it’s because I was elected to fight for you and I fight harder than anybody has ever fought for you. And I had a very nice life before this, I will tell you. And a lot easier. But I love this, that I would have never, ever change because we are doing more for this country than any administration has ever done despite the witch hunts and the phony stuff that we caught them on now. We caught them cold and we’ll see what happens with that. Just watch, stay tuned. Right now I’m fighting to make sure we eradicate the virus, rebuild the economy and save our country from the radical left. We’re hitting record stock market numbers, record 401Ks, record stocks, record job numbers. Don’t blow it. Don’t blow it. Sleepy Joe wants to quadruple your taxes. He wants to quadruple. How about where he gets caught again, he said, “Oh no, we’re not going to give a tax increase, but we’re going to terminate all of the Trump tax cuts.” Well, that’s $2,000 plus child tax credits, plus all of the other things, you’re talking about $6,000, $7,000, $8,000 a year. I don’t think Florida is going to be paying that per family. And if you add energy into that, we have energy at all time low. We’re energy independent. Nobody ever thought that was going to happen. And when you are paying less than $2 at the pump like you are, nobody ever thought you’d see those days again. And those days are here for a long time if we’re smart. We’ve been beating China. We’ve been beating everybody. Until the plague came in, we were teaching China like they’ve never been taught before and they know it. And they’ve told me that and they never thought it could happen. And we’re very soon going to be doing it again. We achieved all of this despite the fact that we caught them cold. They were spying on our campaign. It’s our campaign. It’s our campaign, not my campaign. There was spying on our campaign and illegally trying to take down a very, very straightforward and legally sworn in administration. We were sworn in. They tried before the fact, they tried after the fact. We were an admin… And then they say, “We want to know if you will agree with a friendly transfer of power.” For four years, they’ve been trying to get us out of office. Four years they’ve been trying to get us out, but we’ll take care of it all after the election. We caught them cold. We caught them cold. Bad people, crooked Hillary. And by the way, Obama and Biden knew everything that was happening, okay? Just in case you had any question. We’ll take care of it after the election. Joe Biden and the Democrat socialists, but that gives you another reason to go out and vote. We got to get in. Because we don’t, they’ll just sweep it under the rug. Joe Biden and the Democrat socialists will kill your jobs, dismantle your police departments, dissolve your borders. You know that? Release criminal aliens, confiscate your guns. No more Second Amendment, get used to it. Destroy your suburbs and drive God from the public square. That’s what’s going to happen. You saw in the pledge of allegiance during the Democrat National Convention. They took the word God out twice. They said, “Oh, we made a mistake. Excuse me.” And then it happened a second time. We said, “Well, I guess that wasn’t a mistake, right?” Biden even refuses to answer questions on the packing of the Supreme Court. Nobody even thought of that for many, many, many decades. And that’s what they want to do. They can’t get there legitimately. So they’re said, “That’s all right. We’ll just pack the court. We’ll put a lot of super lefties on the court and we’ll have a whole different country.” Nope. Not going to happen that way. We’re not going to let it happen. You got to get out and vote. A lot of people said that I was elected because of the Supreme Court, because I said I’m going to put great conservative, constitutionalists, great judges on the Supreme Court. I don’t know if it’s true. But if it is true, it’s more true now than it was four years ago. And you got to get out and vote because they’re going to destroy our country and they’re going to destroy our US Supreme Court, and we can’t let that happen. But who would have thought? We’re on number three. Other presidents have never had any. They’ve never had any. We’re at three already, three and a half years. And I will say this, I will say this. It’s driving them crazy. It’s driving them crazy. And Amy is fantastic. A great intellect, a great scholar. I think she’s going to be a fantastic US Supreme Court Justice. As America saw earlier today in Amy’s opening statement in the Senate, Judge Barrett, a brilliant scholar who will defend our laws, our rights, our freedom, and our constitution like very few people would have the capability of doing. The radical left is hell bent on destroying everything we love and cherish. They’re enraged and unhinged out of vengeance and nobody can believe what they’re doing and where they’re going, but we understand it. We understand their canceled culture. We’re not letting them cancel culture us at all. We’re proud of our country and we’re proud of our heritage. They want to punish the middle-class, expunge every last trace of traditional values and replace the American dream with a socialist nightmare, and that’s what it is. They want to turn America into communist Cuba or socialist Venezuela, and ruin the lives of Hispanic Americans and all Americans. And I want to thank the Hispanic Americans down in Florida. You have been so incredible to Trump. Biden’s agenda would be a catastrophe for Florida seniors. And by the way, Biden was a big lover of Castro. You do know that, right? And you know the deal that I broke, you saw that? Right as I came into office, Obama gave the whole planet away to Castro. And I said, “No, thank you. We’re not doing that.” That’s why we just got the Bay of Pigs award from the Cuban Americans, thank you very much. And a lot of them are here. Thank you all very much. Bay of Pigs. For years, Biden tried to cut Social Security and Medicare. You know all about that. Now Biden is pledging mass amnesty and federal healthcare for illegal aliens. Now, we all have a heart and we all want to take care of people. But what you’re doing is you’re telling millions of people to pour up into our country. We’re going to give you education. We’re going to give you healthcare. We’re going to give you everything. We can’t do it. We can’t afford it. We can’t take care of our own people. We have to take care of our people first. And if they let that happen, you would be decimating Medicare and destroying your Social Security. While I’m president, no one will touch your Medicare. No one will touch or hurt in any way, shape or form your Social Security. With your vote I will finish building the strongest economy the world has ever seen and we were there. Last year was the greatest year in the history of the State of Florida. And I have to say, it was practically that way for almost every state in the union. But it was Florida’s best year. The year coming is going to be, and you’re going to see a great third quarter set of numbers coming out very soon just before the election. So I’m putting myself on the spot. The third quarter numbers are going to be record setting phenomenal numbers. Next year is going to be the best year we’ve ever had economically. But as I’ve done from the beginning, I will keep every promise and I will always put America first. You haven’t heard that, right? You haven’t heard that from other people. Under my leadership, we’re delivering a safe vaccine and a rapid recovery like nobody could even believe. And if you look at our upward path, no country in the world has recovered the way we’ve recovered economically or otherwise, not even close. And if you vote for me, prosperity will surge. Normal life, that’s all we want. We want a normal life. We’ll fully resume. And the Florida tourism and hospitality industries that I know so well, will reach historic new highs. Highs like they’ve never reached before. Biden would terminate our recovery. Delay the vaccine, prolong the pandemic and annihilate Florida’s economy with a draconian unscientific lockdown. That’s what he- … his economy with a draconian, unscientific lockdown. That’s what he wants to do, lock it down. Lock it down, everybody. And you know what? If you don’t feel good about going out, stay, relax, stay. You know the risk groups, you know the older people. See, fortunately, I’m not an old person. I’m very young and I’m in such perfect shape. I’m in such great shape. I said that the other day. I said, “Well, I’m very young, and I’m in great shape, perfect shape.” And they said, “Donald Trump misrepresented today, again. He said he was in great shape, that he’s very young.” These people are the sickest of them all. But the World Health Organization, did you see what happened? They just came out a little while ago, and they admitted the Donald Trump was right. The lockdowns are doing tremendous damage to these Democrat-run states, where they’re locked out, sealed up. Suicide rates, drug rates, alcoholism, deaths by so many different forms. You can’t do that. And I want to just congratulate the governor and everybody in Florida. You’re open and open for business and doing great. And we got to remember, I said it right at the beginning, the cure cannot be worse than the problem itself. The cure can not be worse, but if you don’t feel good about it, if you want to stay, stay, relax, stay. But if you want to get out there, get out. One thing with me, the nice part, I went through it. Now they say I’m immune. I feel so powerful. I will walk into that audience. I’ll walk in there, I’ll kiss everyone in that audience. I’ll kiss the guys and the beautiful women, and everybody. I’ll just give you a big, fat kiss. No, but there is something nice. I don’t have to be locked up in my basement, and I wouldn’t allow that to happen anyway. I wouldn’t allow it to happen. When you’re the president, you can’t lock yourself in a basement and say, “I’m not going to bother with the world.” You got to get out, and it’s risky. It’s risky, but you got to get out. But it does give you a good feeling when you can beat something, and now they say you’re immune. I don’t know for how long. Some people say for life. Some people say for four months. I mean, every time I think about it, every time I hear them, it gets shorter and shorter and shorter, because they want it to be as bad as possible. But it is a great feeling. I want to thank, by the way, Walter Reed Medical Hospital, Johns Hopkins. These guys are incredible. We’re 90% better now than we were six, seven months ago, in terms of a cure for people that get really sick, 90%. It’s incredible what’s happened. And with children is 99.9%, you’re going to be okay. You’re going to be okay. 99. 9. They have a little better immune systems, we just learned that, better than you have, better than we all have. But we love our children, but we have to get our schools open. We have to get up businesses going back. We have to get our country rolling, and it is rolling. You’re going to see that when the numbers come out. The Biden virus plan … and you got to remember, he took H1N1, which he always calls in N1H1. He gets it mixed up. I said, “No, Joe. H comes first.” But it’s called the swine flu. Right? And his own person, his chief of staff, said that it was a disaster the way they ran it. A much less lethal problem, but a disaster, the way they ran it, a total catastrophe. It was so bad. It was so bad. And then he says, “I’m going to tell him what to do. But when I locked down China, he thought it was a terrible thing. He called me xenophobic when I locked down China, which was in January, months earlier than what he said. Then ultimately, admitted I’m right, but then he said, “Oh, he should have acted faster.” Well, this was months later that he says I should have acted … Nobody acted fast like I did. I also shut down, locked down Europe, if you remember. And the bottom line is we saved millions of lives. When this first came out, if we didn’t do a good job, they predicted 2.2 million people would die. We’re 210,000. We shouldn’t be at one. It’s China’s fault. They allowed this to happen. They allowed it to escape China. But 2.2 million people would have died. Just remember that, just to remember that, a fact they don’t like talking about. I have such respect for the people of this country, the way they’ve handled it. It’s been an incredible love fest together. That’s really what it’s been. And sympathies from all of us, to those people who, whose family members have died, whose friends … I’ve lost friends. I’ve lost friends. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. You’re going to love me even more. You’re going to love me even more, because we’re years ahead on vaccines, and they’re going to be distributed very shortly. I mean, frankly, it’s a big political deal going on, where they don’t want it to be before the election. Don’t let it be. But we have great vaccines coming. Johnson & Johnson, Moderna, Pfizer. I mean, we have great, great things happening with the vaccines. I think even greater with the cures and with the therapeutics. And maybe it’s why I’m here with you. Maybe it’s not, I’m not sure. I know one thing, I was very happy to take it, that I can tell you. But through Operation Warp Speed, we’re on track to have 100 million vaccine doses before the end of this year, and they’ll be delivered by the military, and they’re all set to go. They’re waiting for final approval. And that vaccine will end the pandemic, but we’re also launching a historic effort to bring your medical supply chains back home. In 1996, Joe Biden voted to obliterate Puerto Rico’s thriving pharmaceutical industry. Remember, they used to have a great pharmaceutical industry. He cut it out. And when he cut it out, he sent Puerto Rico into a nosedive like nobody’s ever seen before. So we’re bringing it all back, and we’re bringing it back to Florida too. We’re bringing it all the way back, taking our jobs away from China. We’re bringing it back from China. I’ll reverse. Biden’s catastrophic decision. We’ll bring it all back. The drug industry’s coming back into Puerto Rico, coming back into, by the way, Pennsylvania, coming back into North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, coming back into Michigan, coming back into Ohio. We’re bringing it all back. Last month, I also announced an additional $13 billion in disaster relief for Puerto Rico and for Florida. Have I taken care of Florida. Have I taken care of Florida. My administration’s allocated over $60 billion. And if you look at Florida, where your great governors, your last two governors have been great, your two senators, great. They’re always calling, asking for money, but I guess that’s what they’re supposed to be doing. And I’m always giving it when it comes to Florida. The panhandle got hit really hard over the last two years. We took care of the panhandle. So days ago, I was honored to receive the endorsement of the governor of Puerto Rico. Can you believe that? Right? Wanda Vázquez Garced. And she was so nice. They were also joined by several great Puerto Rican community leaders, , , , Myra Guzman-Kaslow and candidate for Congress. Dr. Leo Valentina. Please, where are you? Where are you? . I’m not going to say the best, but I’m just about the best thing that ever happened to Puerto Rico. You better vote for me, Puerto Rico. You better vote. But I’ll always be fighting for Puerto Rico. It’s very unfair the way they were treated by Democrats. And while Biden will surrender your jobs to China, your country and your fellow politicians, and I have a lot of great ones right here, including your governor. Wow. We will never allow ourselves to even think about surrendering to the left wing mob. They’re on the run. They’re on the run. Better not have them have a little bit of a victory, because if they have even a little victory, it’s not going to be good. I’m bringing our jobs back home and putting violent criminals behind bars. I’m working with your political leaders. We’ve also directed the FBI to immediately investigate the destruction of the Teddy Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln statues in Portland and to prosecute the offenders to the fullest extent of federal law. Biden supporters are causing mayhem in the streets. If he wins, there will be nothing but bedlam all over the place, but he’s not going to win. He may be the worst presidential candidate in history, and I got him, I got him. It actually puts more pressure on you. If you ran against a great candidate, there’s actually less pressure. You want to know the truth. Thank you. Thank you. No, we want to keep our country great. We’re bringing it to a level that it’s never been. Our military has equipment the likes of which nobody has ever seen, no country has ever seen, all made in the USA, rockets, missiles, tanks, ships, the likes of which, jet fighters, bombers, tankers, the likes of which no country has ever seen before. Our nuclear arsenal is the strongest by far in the world, the strongest it’s ever been. And hope to God, we never have to even think about using it. And the way you won’t have to use it is to have it. At our debate, Biden could not name a single law enforcement organization that supports him, not one, and that’s because … And by the way, did Vice President Mike Pence do a great job? Right? . Did a great job. But it’s because Biden and Harris, that’s another great one. There was nobody so mean to Biden than her, nobody. And so, brilliantly, I said he can’t pick her, because nobody treated him as badly. Although I will say this, had Elizabeth Pocahontas Warren got out prior to Super Tuesday, we would have had Bernie instead. But I’d rather have Biden, because he’s now alienated the left. He’s alienated the right. Nobody knows what the hell he stands for. How about Pennsylvania? He goes to Pennsylvania. For a year-and-a-half, he’s against fracking. The day he gets the nomination, through a little luck, because she didn’t get out. So she took all of Bernie’s votes, right? But following day, he said, “I’m in favor of fracking.” But he’s not. And it doesn’t matter, because the radical left will never let Pennsylvania and Texas and Oklahoma and North Dakota and Ohio, never let them frack. That’s over with. But can you imagine? And the press, which is fake and corrupt, the press never said … Have you ever heard him asked? No. Have you ever heard him asked once, “Well, wait a minute. For one year, you said there will be no fracking.” And he said it strongly, right? You know, “Read my lips.” Right? To use an old expression, “Read my lips, there will be no fracking.” That didn’t work out too well. So now he goes, and he says there will be fracking. Not once have I heard the question. Not once have I asked why Hunter was able to take $3.5 million from the wife of the mayor of Moscow. Not once have I heard these frauds back there. Not once have I heard the fake news. Not once have I heard him say, “A billion dollars. If you don’t change that prosecutor, you’re not getting the billion dollars.” And then he goes, “Whoa, the prosecutor was changed.” The prosecutor against his son. Not once have I heard them talking about that question. Can you imagine if we did that? And on top of everything else, the Democrat Party declared war on our great police and law enforcement. That’s what it is. So I proudly received the endorsements of the Fraternal Order of Police, the National Association of Police Organizations, the National Troopers Coalition, the International Union of Police Associations, the National Latino Police Officers Association, the Florida police chiefs and all of these incredible organizations, plus all over the country. And when I asked him, “Name one organization, give me one organization.” During our debate, where he was saved by the moderator about four times, he couldn’t answer it. Name one law enforcement organization. He couldn’t name one. Then I said, “Say the words, law enforcement, just say it.” Couldn’t do it. He couldn’t say it. We’re joined tonight by a great group of people, warriors, really warriors. He came to me a couple of years ago. He said, “Sir, I want to run for governor.” I said, “Ron, I don’t know. Do they know you well enough?” But he was a great defender and a brilliant guy, Harvard, Yale, top of his class, smart as hell. Nobody knows how smart. Don’t tell too many people. He likes to catch you by surprise. But he’s a great, great guy, and he’s been a great friend. I said, “All right, I’ll endorse you.” I endorsed him, and the rest … he went like a rocket ship, and he handled the pressure. And his wife, Casey, is better than him. I’ve been saying it for a long time. Governor Ron De Santis and Casey. Great guy. Great, great couple. Great, great couple. Smart, brilliant. Sit down, please. Really, they’re a great group of people. Those people are great, and he surrounds himself with incredible people, with the exception, of course, of Representative Matt Gaetz. Oh, Matt Gaetz. You talk about a warrior, right? Ron, what do you think, huh? Matt Gaetz is a great man, a great gentleman, and what a future he has. I don’t know about swap it, but I think I might. Thank you, Matt. Thank you.. Thank you both for being here. Appreciate it. John Rutherford. Where is John? John? Thank you, John. Mike Waltz. Mike, thank you. Thank you. Nice couple. Gus Bilirakis. Gus? Gus? Congressional candidate, somebody who’s supposed to be potentially a superstar. Now, we’ve heard that a lot. Sometimes it works out. It’s going to in his case, Scott Franklin. Scott? Thank you. Oh, he’s got the look. He could be. That’s good. That’s good. I hear good things, Scott. Going well? How’s he doing, Ron? He’s doing good? Ron says you’re doing good. Good. You got to win it. Thank you, Scott, very much. Kimberly. Where’s Kimberly? Kimberly? Thank you. I watched you coming in, speaking. I said, “That’s a lot to follow.” Kimberly is great. I want to thank Kimberly. And finally, we’re joined by a group of amazing supporters who recently walked away from the Democrats and will be … … supporters who recently walked away from the Democrats and will be voting for us. We have a lot of, a lot of them. And a lot of them in law enforcement, a lot of law enforcement, they were democrats, in some cases they left their party. In other cases, they just said, “No, we’re voting for Trump.” I said, “Why are you doing that?” “We have no choice.” I said, “You’re right, you’re right.” But nobody’s been better to law enforcement than I have. You know when I first came in, we gave away hundreds of millions of dollars of military equipment that was in storage. Wasn’t doing anybody any good, it was collecting dust, probably paying rent all over the place. That’s probably why they had it, come to think of it. But look how far that crowd goes back. Hey, hey cameras, will you please? Oh man, look at that. Man. That’s into those hangers. Wow. You know, these are the real polls. So when did you hear about this meeting, like a day ago, these are the real polls, right? The other guy gets out there and he’s … they work at work and work and 30 people show up. They put them in those crazy circles, right? They only have the circles because that’s the only way they can fill up the room, it’s true. But that’s a fantastic group of people, thank you. Same thing over here. I wish the fake news would turn the cameras. For a long time, I didn’t think the cameras moved that way, but then anytime there was a little sign of problems, they could twist around like a pretzel and I realized they could. But they don’t like to show those crowds, but that is a massive amount. I don’t know how many people are here, but you got a lot. I want to thank you. So this evening, we’re also praying for all of the families on the Florida Panhandle effected by Hurricane Sally. And I will tell you, Ron and Marco, and everybody, I’ll tell you, Rick, everybody’s been calling and calling. Matt Gates has been going … driving us a little crazy. Matt, you can take it a little easy. But that’s what somebody that’s good is supposed to do, right? You’re supposed to call. But we take care of the Panhandle and we’re doing it at a level that’s never been done before. And I’ve done it, I think I can say right from the beginning, right? I tell the story about Ron DeSantis. He came to see me, he just became governor. “We had a hurricane. Sir, thank you very much for the money you send to the Panhandle in Florida. I appreciate it.” “Good, Ron, good. I hope it’s enough. Good, spend it well.” I get a call like three days later. “Sir, could I see you?” Now, I’m in Washington. I say, “You don’t have to come up, tell me.” “No, no, no, it’s very important. Sir,” comes into the oval office, “Sir, could we have an extra $500 million?” I said, “Ron, will it ever end, Ron?” And one thing I found out, it never ends for the Panhandle and for Ron, but we take care of it, right, Ron? We take care of it. Great, great people, you have great people. They’re warriors, I’ll tell you. They’re warriors, they’re fighters. We need more people like that, I will tell you. Last month they approved a major disaster declaration for the state of Florida. And I’ll be with you through every step of the rebuilding and you’ll be hit with others. The one thing we know about Florida, you’re very good at this stuff. You get hit by hurricanes and you rebuild, and you rebuild fast, and it’s incredible. I’ve watched, I’ve watched and you don’t want much help either. You’re proud people, you’re incredible people. You put it back together. But we’re there for you all the way. And were there monetarily and we’re there with FEMA. And I think Ron, FEMA’s been incredible, haven’t they, right? Yeah, they’ve been incredible. Thank you to FEMA. We have a lot of FEMA people here, right over there. We spent the last four years reversing the damage Biden has inflicted over the last 47 years with that ridiculous, dumb thought NAFTA, T.P.P., and China’s entry into the World Trade Organization, a disaster for our country. China is considered a developing nation. I stopped that. China’s considered a develop … in other words, China, they’re so wonderful they’re developing, isn’t that nice? Now by being a developing nation, they get much more benefits than a nation that’s not a developing. So I said, “Well, we’re a developing nation too, if they’re a developing nation.” And we just won, you know this, we just won seven and a half billion dollars from the World Trade Organization. And from the World Health Organization, I took us out. They said, “Why did you do that?” I said, “Number one, they were wrong on everything.” Although, they corrected themselves today and they said I was right for the lockdowns. But I said, “Number two, why are we paying 500 million a year? And China, which has one point four billion people is paying 39 million a year, explain that?” They couldn’t explain, it was very hard to explain. So I took us out for that and other reasons, okay. So we’ll see what happens with that. But these are the deals. I could go over hundreds of different things with you and just common sense. I mean, common sense, what we do. Think of it, World Health Organization, we spend … we have 325 million people, we spend $500 million. China spends $39 million and China dominates them. I said, “Doesn’t work that way anymore, doesn’t work that way anymore.” They’ll take us back in so fast at much less money. For decades, our politicians spend trillions and trillions of dollars rebuilding foreign nations, fighting foreign wars and defending foreign borders. But now we are finally protecting our nation, rebuilding our cities, and we are bringing our jobs, and our factory, and our troops back home to the U.S.A. But those dismal days of betrayal and that’s what we were, we were betrayed by our own politicians, whether it was on purpose, or that they were just plain stupid. We’ll come back with unprecedented force if Washington Democrats are allowed to take control again, we can’t let it happen. You have got to get out and vote. Sleepy Joe Biden, and it wasn’t him, it’s the people that control him. He’s controlled totally. Has put forward the most radical platform in American history, including a plan to eliminate U.S. borders. Oh, that’s wonderful, where’s our border? We don’t have one, just come in, everybody come on in, come on in everybody. If you’re a murderer, if you’re a rapist, if you’re very, very sick with a disease that can spread all over, just come on in. We’re up to almost 400 miles of wall, nobody talks about that anymore. And we now have the tightest, safest border in our country’s history, but we’re up to almost 400 miles, it’ll be finished very soon. And it’s top of the line. It’s exactly what border patrol wanted. But by implementing nationwide catch and release, imposing deadly sanctuary cities nationwide, nationwide, they want sanctuary cities, that’s what they want. I don’t even think … I’ll tell you, I know a lot of people in California, they don’t want sanctuary cities. It’s like the politicians want it. I don’t think the people want it. But they want to suspend all removals of illegals out of our country, whether they’re murderers, rapists, thugs, bank robbers, they don’t care. They want to suspend it. You almost say, where the hell are they coming from? Where does it even … where does the thought process come? It’s demented. It would mean the total nullification of all U.S. borders, overwhelming every city and town in America, including this wonderful place that we all love very much. Under my leadership, we achieved the most secure border in U.S. history and we’re finishing that wall. It’s going to be finished and so beautiful, wait’ll you see that. Wait’ll see that. A few more months. We’re doing 10 miles a day. And by the way, Mexico is paying, they hate to say it. Mexico is paying for it. And Mexico’s been great. Mexico has 27,000 of their soldiers on our border. And I said, you have to do that, otherwise we’re going to have to charge you tariffs because we’re not going to stand for it. When people are pouring into our … and we have the worst laws because Congress over the years has made it so weak. If you’re a soldier and you talk rudely to somebody, they ended up giving you the electric chair, okay? It’s so horrible. Mexico has been great. 27,000 soldiers we have, see, 27. Now the electric chair comment, they’ll put that, “He’s exaggerating. He shouldn’t do that.” They are sick people. But it is true, we have 27,000 Mexican soldiers guarding our border and you know what, they don’t play games. They don’t let them through. And if they do let them through, we get very angry with Mexico. So Mexico’s been great. The president of Mexico’s been great. We’re putting a border tax on for cars and trucks that go across. It will much more than pay for our wall, starting soon. Remember when the old days we used to say, we’ll build the wall, everybody thought there was no way. It’s one of the largest projects in the history of our country, because you’re talking about a lot of miles, 540 miles. And then we may even add some more into other areas where you probably, you have natural barriers like mountains and rivers, and a lot of other pretty tough areas. But we may even add some more. We’re doing so great with it, 10 miles a day. And I want to thank the Army Corps of Engineers, you’ve been incredible. Some of them are here, they’re very proud people. One thing with the Army Corps, they may build it a little expensive, but you can’t rip that sucker down and it never . That’ll never come down. We ended the catch and release ridiculous program where you catch somebody, you take their name, and then you release them. And you say, come back in three years to a court case. And nobody ever comes back, except for the really dumb ones, they come back on occasion. But nobody ever comes back, they’re in our country. They could be murderers and they could be all sorts of problems and we’re not having that. We ended it. We stopped asylum fraud and we’ve deported 20,000 gang members, including MS-13. Brought them back to their country. We brought them back to their country. We’ve now deported over a half a million criminal illegal aliens, think of that, think of that. And outside of poorly run Democrat states and cities, you don’t have crime in this country. Our country is doing fantastically. And I call up governors in Portland, and I call up from the state and I call up the governor, as an example, Oregon. I say, “We’d love to send some people to help you out with Oregon and to help you out with Portland. We’ll solve the problem in a half an hour, like we did in Minnesota with Minneapolis. We’ll solve the problem quickly.” Remember Minneapolis was burning down, day after day and I’d call, let us come in, let us come in. Anyway, they finally came in. How long did it take? About a half an hour. Remember the beautiful scene, they lined up. They weren’t socially distanced, but that’s okay. They lined up, then another line, another line. Then they just walk forward and that was the end of that. And I think we’re going to win the state of Minnesota because of it, I think. Hasn’t been won since 1972, but it’s looking like we’re going to win Minnesota because of it because nobody, I mean what they did. But I give the governor credit, at least, even though it was too long, he let us in. Oregon, we have to send in the troops. We will solve that problem in 30 minutes. We sent in the U.S. Marshals. Recently, when the man, this horrible human being shot somebody and killed them in the middle of the street. Two days went by, three days went by, I said, “Why hasn’t he been arrested?” We sent in the U.S Marshals. In 15 minutes it was all over, 15 minutes. Be so easy to do. I mean, can you imagine these people for years and years, it’s been anarchy in Portland, for years and years. But not for the Republicans. This is why you cannot have the Democrats and that whole philosophy, that whole craziness, you can not have them involved in running your country. We invested two point five trillion dollars in the U.S. military, including funding to save Tyndall Air Force Base, because who knows Tyndall. Who is … well, not that big a group. That’s not like a big group. I can tell you if you were in the Panhandle, you’d be saying, thank you very much. It was wiped out by the hurricane and Ron called, and a number of people called, and Marco called, Rick Scott called, they all called. They wanted to save Tyndall and we did it. And now it’s brand new, gorgeous, and really moving along well, right? We did a good job there, I think so. We launched the first new branch of the U.S. Armed Forces in nearly 75 years called Space Force, very . For an administration, if you think of it, so not for 75 years, we’ve created a new force, right? The Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines. So think of it, Coast Guard. And now we just created a new force, first time at 75 years, if I did nothing but that, that’s a big deal. And that’s peanuts, that’s peanuts. Because we built the greatest economy in history. We cut taxes more than any other president by far in history. We cut regulations, which I think is maybe just as important as the taxes, that’s why our businesses are roaring back. We’ve done things that nobody else has done, nobody else has. And these people back here, they don’t even challenge me on it, which is shocking. Usually you think they’d challenge you, even if they’re wrong. I also brought back NASA, the greatest space center, again, in the world. And we passed V.A. Choice and V.A. Accountability for our great vets, right? And we just got a 91% approval rating, Ron. 91% approval rating by the vets on the way we’re running it, never happened before. That’s never happened before, Rick, never happened before. We killed the leader of ISIS who was trying to reform ISIS because we blew it into oblivion. We killed al-Baghdadi, they were looking for him for years and years and years. Guess who got him? We took out the world’s number one terrorist and the mass murder of American troops and many, many people all over the world, Qasem Soleimani, he’s dead, gone. I withdrew from the last administration’s disastrous Iran Nuclear Deal, which was a catastrophe. President Obama give us $150 billion and we’ll give you nothing. Give us one point eight billion in green, in cash. He gave him one point eight billion in cash. That’s when I realized how powerful the presidency is, when you could do that. What a horrible deal. But we broke the deal, and I’ll tell you probably the first call I’ll get after we win the election will be from Iran dying to make a deal because they’re down 28% GDP, nobody’s ever heard of a thing like that. That’ll be the first call I get. They cannot have a nuclear weapon. I kept my promise, recognized the true capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. And every president promised to do it. Every president said they were going to do that for many, many decades. They all were going to do that. Nobody did it because once they got in office, there was a lot of pressure on you not to do it. I could tell you, I was called by every foreign leader, “Please don’t do it. Please don’t do-” Not to do it. I can tell you I was called by every foreign leader. Please don’t do it. Please don’t do it. I tell the story. I said, listen, tell them, I’ll call them back in a couple of days. Then, I did it. I called him back. Hey, what’s up? I also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. 52 years they’ve been working on that. They’ve been working on that for 52 years. They couldn’t get anything. Every year, people would fly in, stay, wine, dine, have a good time and leave. Nothing would happen. 52 years. I got it done in one day. Instead of these endless wars, we’re forging peace in the Middle East and peace without blood all over the sand, and you see what’s happening. In fact, a point that they didn’t report, I’ve been, I guess three or four, maybe now, Nobel Peace Prizes. Can you believe it? Four, three. I told a story. I told my wife. Oh, we’re going to have a great time. We’re going to watch television. I just got nominated for the Nobel Prize. And then I turned on the fake news. Story after story. They talk about your weather in the panhandle run. They talk about this. Story after story. No mention. Remember, when Obama got it right at the beginning and he didn’t even know why he got it? It was the biggest story you’ve ever seen. The last administration made a pathetic one-sided deal with the Castro dictatorship that betrayed the Cuban people and enriched the communist regime. They’re not enriched any longer. My opponent stands with socialists and communists. He wants to give everything away to Cuba. He wants to give it away to Nicaragua and Venezuela, not going to happen, not going to happen, not going to happen. I stand with the people of Cuba and Nicaragua and Venezuela in their righteous struggle for freedom. The last administration also negotiated the terrible Obama-Biden Santos steel with Colombian drug cartels. They surrendered the narco terrorists. They surrendered totally gave up to him and that caused illicit drugs and illicit drugs all over this country. Joe Biden even received the endorsement of Colombian socialists, Gustavo Petro, a former member of the M19 Guerrilla organization, and he took it, because you know why, he didn’t know who the hell it was. He said, I’ll take it. I’ll take whoever. And I said, no, he’s a bad guy, Joe. He’s actually a bad guy. Under my administration, we worked with Colombian officials to seize or disrupt 227 metric tons of poisonous narcotics since April, and we’re doing fantastically in terms of bringing it down, 19% reduction. My heart will always be with the Colombian people and the people from Cuba and the people from Venezuela and Nicaragua and all of the people that are so unfairly treated, and you’ll see a lot of great things happen. I did more in 47 months than Joe Biden did in 47 years. And now he’s pushing the most far left agenda ever foot forward by a Presidential nominee or candidate. The Biden Plan would destroy Social Security and destroy protections for pre-existing conditions. You’re going to have nothing left, this crazy new Green New Deal. The Green New Deal. I mean, what’s that all about? Biden’s running mate sponsored The Green New Deal and the Socialist Healthcare takeover. You’re going to have Socialist Healthcare. You don’t feel well? Okay. Go to the hospital. Stay there for about four weeks. They’ll shut down american energy, shut down fracking and outlaw the private health insurance plans of over 180 million Americans who love those plans. Biden vowed to terminate our travel bans on jihadist regions and surge refugee admissions. He agreed to this with crazy Bernie Sanders. He’s going to surge admissions into our country by agreed number 700%. No, thank you. Opening the flood gates to radical Islamic terrorism, and I don’t like to speak too loud, but we’re not doing too badly, are we? He’ll ban school choice. He’ll ban charter schools and he’ll ban Florida opportunity scholarships, which is a big deal, a big deal. He wants to put him out of business run. In a second term, I’ll provide school choice to every parent in America. A vote for Republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs, and a limitless future for all Americans. And I just have to say in conclusion, over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world. And we will end our reliance on China once and for all. It’s ending. We will hire more police, increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement, and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities, which you’re already doing. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech and the right to keep and bear arms, your second Amendment. We will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens, and we will keep America out of these ridiculous, horrible and very, very stupid foreign wars against countries that you’ve never even heard of. We will maintain America’s unrivaled military might, and we will ensure peace through strength. We will end surprise medical billing, require price transparency. It’s already signed and it takes place on January 1st, and further reduce the cost of prescription drugs by 50, 60, 70, and even 80%. We will strongly protect Medicare and Social Security, and we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions, always. Republicans will always protect. America will land the first woman on the moon, and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars, and it’s going to be very soon. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools. We will teach our children to love our country, to honor our history and always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, ” in God we trust.” For years, you had a President who apologized for America. Now, you have a President who is standing up for America and standing up for the great people of Florida. So, get out there and vote. Send in your absentee ballot if you’ve requested one. Be very careful, a lot of shenanigans going on. You see what’s happening. Every day you’re reading it. In person early voting begins next week. So, get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors and get out and vote. You have no choice. You have to do it. True. You got to do it. We’re going to win Florida big. We’re going to win a lot of states big. We’re leading in Arizona. We’re leading in Nevada. We think we’re leading in Pennsylvania. We’re leading in North Carolina. We’re leading all over the place. We got to have this be a big win. From Tampa to Tallahassee, from Pensacola to Miami, and from Jacksonville to right here in Sanford, we stand on the shoulders of Florida Patriots who gave their blood, sweat, and tears for this beloved nation. We stand on the shoulders of American heroes across the oceans, blaze the trails, settle the continent, tame the wilderness, lay down the railroads, dug out the Panama Canal, raised up the skyscrapers, won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and from here in this beautiful state, landed our brave American astronauts on the face of the moon. We made America into the single greatest nation in the history of the world, and the best is yet to come. Proud citizens like you help build this country and together we are taking back our country. We’re returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. And when Ron DeSantis comes to my office in Washington, the magnificent oval office, and he says to me, sir, sir, the people of Florida, they’ve won too much. They’re getting tired of winning. I’m going to look at him. I’m going to say Mr. Governor, go back and tell them, don’t worry about it. You’re going to keep on winning, winning, winning. That’s what they want to do. We’re going to keep on winning, winning, winning. Because we’re one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God, and together with the incredible people of Florida, we have made America wealthy again. We have made America strong again. We have made America proud again, and we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you, Florida. Thank you very much. Thank you. Hello, Johnstown. Thank you very much. This is going to be a great evening. Incredible to be back in Pennsylvania, the proud home of American independence, the American constitution and American freedom. That’s true. Huh? What a history. And 21 days days from now, we’re going to win the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and we’re going to win four more years in the White House. This election is a simple choice. If Biden wins, China wins, all these other countries win. We get ripped off by everybody. If we win, you win, Pennsylvania wins and America wins, very simple. For years, the selfish and corrupt political class betrayed the people of Pennsylvania, you know that, and the people of our country. Career politicians like Joe Biden lied to you. I don’t think he knew he was even lying. You want to know the truth. He’s gone. He’s shot folks. I hate to tell you, he’s shot. He abused you, he crushed you, your dreams and outsourced your jobs to China and distant lands all over the world. As a Senator Biden’s last American trade policies were a total disaster. They dismantled your steel industry and decimated entire towns in your area. And we brought back steel and we put tariffs on steel and we stopped dumping steel and aluminum. As vice-president, he closed down 10,000 factories while raking in cash from corporations that moved jobs overseas, and his family got rich. You know that. How did Hunter make three and a half million dollars from the mayor of Russia, mayor of Moscow’s wife? How did that happen? So you have the mayor of Moscow, got a wife, gave Hunter three and a half million bucks. I wonder what he did for that money, huh? The fake news, they refused to talk about it. They don’t want to hear about it. Biden’s a servant of the radical globalist, the wealthy donors, the big money special interests, who shipped away your jobs, shut down your factories and you know it, because you really suffered right in this area, threw open your borders and ravaged our cities while sacrificing American blood and treasure in these ridiculous, endless foreign wars. They’re all coming back home. Don’t worry. They’re all coming back home, soon. They’re already on their way. They’ve been on their way for a long time. In 2016, Pennsylvania voted to fire this failed and decrepit political establishment. And you elected an outsider as your president to finally put America first. That’s what we did. And we did not come this far, overcome this much, and fight this hard only to surrender our country back to the depraved, Washington swamp. And by the way, did we catch them? We caught them. We caught them. We caught them. Watch what happens. Watch what happens. They spied on our campaign. What they did should never, ever be allowed to happen in this country again, never. Watch what happens. This is the most important election in the history of our country. Biden has made a corrupt bargain in exchange for his party’s nomination. He has handed control to the socialists and Marxists and left-wing extremists like his vice presidential candidate. That’s another great one, isn’t it? I just watched her on television coming in, because the great thing about Air Force One, we have more televisions. They’re in closets. They’re all over the place. They’re on the floors, on the ceilings. And I watched her and I compared her to Amy, great future Supreme court justice. And I will tell you Amy’s made a great impression. And you know, Biden, he can’t stand up to the lunatics running his party. He can’t even find his way off the stage without them. Look what’s happened. Yesterday, he didn’t know the name. He said, “You know the guy, I think he’s a Mormon, right”” He said, “He’s a Mormon.” He was talking about Mitt Romney. He forgot Mitt Romney’s name. Can you imagine that? Can you imagine. Then he didn’t know where he was. He said, “Where the hell am I? Where am I?” No, he’s shot folks. He’s shot. I’m running against the single worst candidate in the history of presidential politics. And you know what that does? That puts more pressure on me. Can you imagine if you lose to a guy like this? It’s unbelievable. It’s disgusting. It’s disgraceful. If he wins, the radical left will be running the country. He won’t be running the country. The radical left will take over. And how about Pennsylvania? So he says, “There will be no fracking, no fracking.” This went on for a year and a half. No fracking, no fracking, no fracking. Then Elizabeth Warren refused to get out. So they stole another one for Bernie. Bernie is the greatest loser of them all. This guy, every four years they steal it. So she refused to get out, Pocahontas. She refused to get out. They wanted me to apologize for saying the word Pocahontas. So no, no. I apologize to Pocahontas, . No, no, she wouldn’t get out. And she took enough votes away and Biden won super Tuesday. That shouldn’t have happened. But if I don’t sound like a typical Washington politician, fortunately that’s because I’m not a politician. I’m not a politician. But think of that, you talk about politician, no fracking for a year and a half, right? And then he goes to Pennsylvania says, “No, no, there’ll be fracking.” Like nothing happened. Can you imagine if I did that? No fracking, no fracking, no fracking. I’m the opposite, by the way. No fracking, no fracking. Then you win and you go, I’ve got to go a little to the other direction, a little bit to the right. Although he actually went further to the left, which is sort of an amazing thing, but all of a sudden he comes out in favor of fracking. And let me tell you, it’s always the first thing that turns out to be true. Okay. They will lose, you will lose, in Pennsylvania a million jobs. There will be no petroleum products. There will be no fracking whatsoever. And did you see his party now is really angry at him because he’s saying maybe there’ll be fracking. It’s a very conditional, it’s a very weak, but with me, you’re going to frack. You’re going to frack. And you’re going to keep your energy low. And we’re independent, we are now energy independent, first time ever. So if I don’t always play by the rules of the Washington establishment it’s because I was elected to fight for you. And I fought harder for you than any president has ever fought for their people. Right now I’m fighting to eradicate the virus, rebuild the economy and save our country from the radical left. And that’s a big thing, saving it, because these people, this will end up being a large scale version of Venezuela, if they get in. They don’t have water. They don’t have medicine. They don’t have food. They don’t have anything. Despite everything they’ve thrown at us, we’ve done more in the first three and a half years than any administration in history. And the best is yet to come. That’s true. A recent Gallup poll just came out. Thank you. A Gallup poll just came out that found that 56% of Americans say they’re better off today than they were under Sleepy Joe and Obama. That’s the highest of any president at this point in his term. Let’s think of that, 56%. This is as we round the corner on the pandemic, 56%. they were much, much lower. Just remember this, if they were any good I wouldn’t have run for president, but they were no good. They did a horrible job. They did a horrible job. Yesterday, Biden told those 56% of Americans that they probably shouldn’t vote for him. And for once I agree with Joe. Did you hear? He said, “You shouldn’t vote for me.” He has no idea what he’s saying. How the hell do you lose to a guy like this? Is this possible. Oh, I’ll never come to Pennsylvania again. I love this place. They say he was born in Scranton, but he left. He left. He abandoned you. Give me a break. Thank you. I love you, too. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. By the way, there’s a lot of people here tonight. Got a lot of people. I wish the fake news would show it. They never turn the cameras. I go home, our great first lady always says, “How was the crowd?” I said, “Didn’t they show it?” “No, they just show your face.” And about five people behind me, right? They become famous. Why don’t you show the crowd though? Why don’t you do yourself a favor, show the crowd. One of the most important issues for Pennsylvania is the survival of your fracking industry. Joe Biden has repeatedly pledged to abolish fracking. He’s a liar. Okay. He’s a liar. How do you do it? How do you do it? He went for a year and a half. They said, “Are you…” remember the debates with the radical left Democrats? You had Alfred E Newman. You had all these people, you know who Alfred E. Newman is? Yes. Pete Buttigieg, Pete Buttigieg, he was a bad mayor of a failed town and he’s going to run for president. Pete Buttigieg, but you know he’s talking about it. And does that mean everybody, nobody is going to do fracking? That’s right. Nobody. Nobody, I swear. Nobody, nobody, nobody. Then he gets up, I’ve never seen anything like it in my life, and not one fake reporter back there said, “Well, wait a minute, you’ve been pledging for a year and a half, no fracking.” But then what about the healthcare for illegal immigrants? Who in this group is going to provide healthcare for illegal immigrants? Everybody raises their hand. You remember Joe? No, do you remember? This is a famous clip, but they don’t ask him questions about it because they’re fake. You remember Joe? Who is going to provide… And look, we all have hearts and we want to take care of everybody. But you know the problem when you do that, we don’t have the money. The whole world is going to empty out into our country. They’re going to come for healthcare. They’re going to come for college, free college. I say sometimes jokingly sarcastically, “Everybody gets a free Rolls-Royce.” To which CNN says, “They don’t get a free Rolls-Royce. He has misrepresented.” These people are sick. Everybody gets a free Rolls-Royce. They don’t get a free Rolls-Royce. The president has misrepresented. They are sick people. But think of it, so remember when Joe and they said, “Raise your hand if everybody’s in favor of free, everything, credit free everything, but free healthcare for illegal aliens.” And Joe goes like, he had no idea what the hell he was doing, folks. He has no clue. And he’s not a nice guy. Just so you understand, not a nice guy. If he was a nice guy, I wouldn’t hit him like this, but he’s not a nice guy. He’s a bad guy. He’s always been a dummy. He’s never been… No, no. In his best of years, he was considered a dumb guy. When asked about fracking, Biden said he “would sure, absolutely make it. We will eliminate it.” That’s what he said. Those are the exact words. And then he said it 19 different times. Then one day he said, “I never said that.” It’s incredible. And they don’t question him. I couldn’t get away with it for a minute, not for a minute. Did you see the town hall he had with NBC? That was a town hall for a child, a young child. Barron Trump, and actually Barron’s far too advanced for that town hall. That was a town hall, Lester Holt, Lester Holt. That was a beauty, right? That was some town hall. And they said, “Yes, we have a random sampling of people.” Yeah. All Trump haters. What a group of people. But he raised his hand. He said, “Illegal immigrants will get healthcare.” Now people don’t realize what that means. That means your social security goes down the tubes, your country goes bankrupt. The whole thing is a disaster, but he raised his hand. Now he’s trying to say he didn’t do it. And they don’t call him out because they’re fake. His radical left running mate, who I just watched on television, she is so pathetic, is a co-sponsor of the socialist green new deal, which eliminates all fossil fuels. She’s having a hard time getting out of that one. Did you hear the other day? She actually came out in favor of fracking. It was like, “Yeah, I think so.” She’s further left than Bernie. Did you see Bernie, I thought was the furthest left in the Senate, because you don’t get too much worse. Then you go, instead of socialists, you go to the C-word, right? She’s further left. She’s considered further left than Bernie. When Nancy Pelosi does the 25th amendment, she’s doing it for Biden. You do know that, right? Because they want to get Biden out and that won’t be hard. But at this very moment, Biden’s website includes a pledge to mandate net zero carbon emissions, which means fossil fuel, coal, everything is gone and it’s gone soon. Okay. And with that goes our economy, and with that goes our country. The Democrat party hates fracking. They hate coal. They hate clean, beautiful coal. I see what they do with coal now. They hate domestic energy production and Biden will shut you down. He wants to shut you down just like your governor’s got you shut down right now. They better open up your state. Did you see the World Health Organization yesterday? They said Trump was right. They said you can’t make the cure worse than the problem itself. I’ve been saying that for a long time. And we did the right thing. We saved 2 million lives. They said 2.2 million people. We saved 2 million lives and we get nothing, and I’ll tell you what, the vaccines are coming soon, the therapeutics and frankly, the cure. All I know is I took something, whatever the hell it was, I felt good very quickly. I don’t know what it was. Antibodies, antibodies. I don’t know. I took it. I said, I felt like Superman. And I said, “Let me at them.” No, and I could have been here four or five days ago. It’s great. We have great doctors. I want to thank the doctors at Walter Reed and Johns Hopkins, great doctors. One great thing about being president, if you’re not feeling 100%, you have more doctors than you thought existed in the world. I was surrounded with 14 of them. Where are you from? “I’m from this one.” Where are you from? “I’m from Johns Hopkins.” “I’m from Walter Reed.” But what great talented people. They did a great job and thank you. And while I’m president, America will remain the world’s number one energy producer with Pennsylvania workers leading the way and that’s what’s happening. You’re leading the way. You’re leading . You know, you had the best year in the history of your place. It’s a history of … if you look at the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, you never want to say state. Don’t ever say state. Actually, nobody cares but them, but you know. I’m just saying, let’s say Pennsylvania, you got two of them. You know that, right? The Commonwealth, the great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. I went to school here. Probably spent more time here than sleepy Joe in all fairness, I went to school here. But we’re putting our great coal miners back to work. Joe Biden and the Democrat socialists will kill your jobs, dismantle your police departments. You see that happening. And we’ve got … Did you see in the debate the other night, I said to him, “Name one law enforcement agency, just one in a whole country that supports you.” He couldn’t do it. Then Chris Wallace bailed him out. Then I say, “How come you got the three and a half million from Russia?” And they bailed him out again. He was choking like a dog. They bailed him out. But they want to dissolve your borders. They don’t want borders. They want to have open borders, release criminal aliens, raise your taxes, confiscate your guns, get rid of your Second Amendment. I mean, here’s one that’s incredible, destroy your suburbs. Okay, so they talk about the suburban women. And somebody said, “I don’t know if the suburban woman likes you.” I say, “Why?” But we had this … I love you too. They said, “They may not like the way you talk,” but I’m about law and order. I’m about having you safe. I’m about having your suburban communities. I don’t want to build low-income housing next to your house. Okay, if that’s okay? And I ended the regulation, the rule that made the zoning so impossible that you had to destroy your communities. And then I hear the suburban woman. I think that the suburban woman, and I used to say suburban housewife, I used to take heat, but I said, “Does anybody care?” Do you care? If I say suburb? No, they’re all going to no. Again, the only one cares is them. “Trump said suburban housewife,” but I didn’t say it because I don’t. You learn very quickly. You learn very quickly. But suburban women, they should like me more than anybody here tonight because I ended the regulation that destroyed your neighborhood. I ended the regulation that brought crime to the suburbs and you’re going to live the American dream. And that’s what you’re going to do. And remember this, 29% of the people experiencing the American dream in the suburbs happened to be minority. And you don’t know that. But 29%. and we’re doing this for everybody. We’re not doing it one way or the other. We’re doing it. And I ended it. They said, “Sir, we can amend it.” I said, “I don’t want to amend it. I want to end it.” It was a horror show. And this loser, Corey Booker is the guy that’s going to be in charge of the program. The guy’s a stone-cold loser. 1%, he got 1%. He ran. He was going to be great. You know, 1%. every week he was like her, down, down, down. They should’ve picked him. But no he’ll be in charge of you’re a suburban … So can I ask you to do me a favor, suburban women, will you please like me? Please. Please. I saved your damn neighborhood, okay? The other thing I don’t have that much time to be that nice. You know, I can do it, but I got to go quickly. We don’t have time. They want me to be politically correct. Yes, let’s discuss it. Let’s talk about it over the next 10 years. No, no, no, no. We saved suburbia in the US. I got rid of a regulation that was a disaster. And it was very unfair. And you’ve been reading about it for a long time. It’s been going on for a long time. It became much worse under Obama and Biden. I got rid of it. And I had a choice. Even my own people said, “You’d never get rid of it, sir.” I said, “I want to get rid of it.” “Well, why don’t we just amend it?” I said, “I don’t want to amend it. I want to get rid of it.” Get rid of it. Okay? And I think we’re going to see that the women really like Trump a lot. That’s happened last time. Remember? Remember last four years ago? Four years ago, they said women will never vote for him. I said, “Why, am I so bad?” They said, “The women will never vote.” Then I got 52%. They said, “What the hell happened with the women?” Except this time, see, this is much easier. Because then I was a developer, I was doing great, everything was nice, but I had never done this before. I came in, I said, “I’m going to rebuild our military. I’m going to cut your taxes. I’m going to cut your regulations. I’m going to get you this, I’m going to get you that. I’m going to take care of our vets.” I mean, I did things that frankly, I never even talked about like space force. I never talked about space force. The wall is almost built. You know, the wall is up to 392 miles. It’s almost built. And Mexico is paying for the wall by the way, you know that. I’ve been saying it. They hate to hear that, but they’re paying. We’re putting a charge on where the cars go through and it will more than pay for the wall. But we have now the most secure Southern border that we’ve ever had. And I want to thank the president of Mexico. They 27,000 Mexican soldiers on our Southern border, stopping people from coming into the US illegally. Thank you very much. No, but we did all these things. So this time in theory, it should be easier. But don’t forget, I’ve gone through years of a fake witch hunt. And now it turned out that they were the guilty party. They were the ones dealing with Russia. They were the guilty people. Think if I didn’t have every night on that fake CNN, right over there with the light on. The light just went off. It just went off. Every time I point to them, the light goes off. It’s all right, keep it off. Nobody’s watching them anyway. But think if I didn’t have every night, Russia, Russia, Russia, hey. And nobody’s been tougher on Russia than me. What I’ve done for NATO. Raised $130 billion a year from other countries that weren’t paying their bills. They were delinquent, as we said in the real estate business. They were delinquent. And that goes up to $410 billion. Nobody did that. Obama used to send them pillows maybe from the pillow man on Fox. Did you ever see a man advertised so much? I’ve never seen it. I’ve never seen the biggest advertising … I think he’s the greatest advertising genius, Mike. If I gave him our budget, you wouldn’t be able to do anything else but watch Trump ads. The pillow, man. I tell you, I never saw so many ads in my life. Every day, it’s a pillow, the pillow. Now he came out with a sheet and I’m going crazy. That’s all we need now is a new sheet. But he’s on our side too by the way, that guy, he’s on our side, Mike. And now Biden even refuses to answer questions on packing the Supreme Court. You know, elections have consequences. Winning and losing an election, that’s big consequences. And we’ve been winning elections. And they say, “Well, you know, Trump shouldn’t be appointing the new justice because …” well, I’m president. In fact, as you know, a lot of your great justices said, “No, no they’re appointed.” Justice Ginsburg just said recently, not so long ago, “No, no. He’s a president for four years. Not for three years. You appoint …” Now, she was referring to Obama, I think, or Clinton or somebody. But wasn’t referring to me, I can promise you that. Oh, don’t worry. Don’t worry. It’s being filled. You don’t have to worry about that. That’s much easier than we’ll build a wall that goes to … that goes for a lot. You know, the wall is one of the biggest projects in the history of this country. You know that right? And we had a party dedicated to the proposition that there will never, ever be a wall. They know was the right thing to do. And I made one big mistake. I should’ve come instead of saying, “We will build a wall,” I should have said, “We will never, ever build a wall.” They would have given me so much money. Made a big mistake. All great congressman over there. Are you guys having a good time, by the way? Huh, Mike? He said the voters don’t deserve to know. And they’ll tell you after the election what he’s going to do. And you know what I did, I gave you a list. I have 45 people on that list. Every one of them is a star. And I gave you a list. Yeah, sit down, everybody. Just enjoy yourself. What the hell? Look at these people. I didn’t even realize you’re all standing. I didn’t realize you had seats. You’re lucky. This is one of the few crowds we provided seats. That’s because it’s Pennsylvania, I guess. It’s pretty good. If they win, Democrats will pack the Supreme Court with radical left justices who will shred your Second Amendment. You can forget about guns, empower violent mobs, and shield deadly criminals and terrorists. To defend our constitution from this madness, I proudly nominated Judge Amy Coney Barrett of the United States Supreme Court and to the court. She’ll be a great justice of the United States Supreme Court. She’s done so well. I really found it fascinating today. I don’t have too much time, but I tried to watch as much as I could. She was great. The radical left is hellbent on destroying everything we love and cherish. They’re enraged and unhinged. And they are going crazy. Think of it, very many presidents never have anybody to appoint. I will have by the end of the first term, almost 300 federal judges and three Supreme Court justices. Their heads are exploding. I hope they’re happy. They want to cancel you, shame you, and persecute you. That’s what they want to do. They want to shame. And this whole cancel culture thing. Now they’re after Abraham Lincoln. They don’t like Abraham Lincoln. No, he wasn’t too good was he? I said this three years ago. Remember when they took down a couple of statues of people you’d never heard of? A Confederate soldier, somebody else, somebody … I said, “Oh, really? Then next will be Robert E. Lee. Then next will be Abraham Lincoln. Then next will be George Washington.” And everybody laughed. They said, “Oh, the president is so funny.” I said, “I’m not being funny. These people are sick.” These people, they want to take away your heritage. And by the way, are there any Italians in the room? Okay, well, we are protecting the legacy of Christopher Columbus. The Italians are tough. I love the Italians. So they were going to rip down the statue of Christopher Columbus in New York. You saw that, right? And all of a sudden, a group of Italian circled around the statue and they were having pretty tough things in their hand, I must say. And it was amazing how those people that wanted to rip it down disappeared very quickly. So the Italians, let me tell you, Christopher Columbus will always be here on my watch, that I can tell you. I had people the other day that wanted to wish me Happy Columbus Day. They were afraid. I said, “Why are you ashamed? No, no, say it. Happy Christopher Columbus Day.” This is Christopher Columbus Day. It’s Columbus Day.” So Italians say, “Thank you Mr. President.” I appreciate it. I like you too. I love the Italians. They want to punish the middle-class, expunged every last trace of traditional values, and replace the American dream with the socialist nightmare. And that’s what would happen. Just take a look at what’s going on in other parts of the world. Biden’s agenda, not that he has one, but you know. He does whatever they tell him to do. He got so lucky. She should have gotten out. She was faithful, she would have gotten out. Bernie would have run. We would have been running against crazy Bernie instead. But I’d rather run against Joe because there’s no enthusiasm. There’s no energy. One thing with Bernie’s people … And you know, we got a lot of people last time from Bernie because they loved me on trade, because they know our country has been ripped off on trade like no country has ever been ripped off. And Bernie’s people get that. And they like us on trade. Biden’s agenda would be a catastrophe for seniors. For years, Biden tried to cut social security and Medicare. Nobody remembers that. And the press will never bring it up. But he tried to cut your social security. Now Biden is pledging mass amnesty and federal health care for the illegal aliens, decimating Medicare and destroying your social security. Biden cares more about illegal aliens than he cares about your senior citizens and it’s true. And let me just tell you this. And I say it strongly, and when I first got elected, they always played the social security card. And nothing happened. Your social security now is better than ever. I haven’t touched it. While I am president, no one will touch your Medicare or your social security. Under my leadership, we’re delivering a safe vaccine and a rapid recovery. If you vote for me, prosperity will surge. Normal life, that’s what we want. Normal life. We want normal life. We’ll fully resume. And next year will be one of the greatest economic years in the history of our country. It’s already happening. How about the stock market? Who has 401ks in the audience? Well, I can tell you one thing, I’m getting all of your votes. I’m getting your votes. Your 401ks is setting records. Think of it, as we’re rounding the turn and we are, they go crazy when I say we’re rounding the turn on the pandemic. We understand it. Hey, I just had it. Here I am. It’s actually me. And I could’ve stayed in the basement of the White House or maybe the top floor of the White House. I could have done that, but I’m the president of the United States. I can’t do that. I got to get out and I have to meet people and I have to see people. And I know it’s risky to do that, but you have to do what you have to do. I’m the president. I can’t sit in the basement and say, “Let’s wait this thing out.” I’m not going to do that. And now I’m immune, they tell me I’m immune. I could come down and start kissing everybody. I’ll kiss every guy, man and woman, man and woman. Look at that guy, how handsome he is. I’ll kiss him. Not with all of enjoyment, but that’s okay. Joe Biden would terminate our recovery, delay the vaccine, prolong the pandemic, and annihilate the economy with draconian, unscientific lockdowns, like you’re having right now in Pennsylvania with this governor who is killing you. Tom Wolf, Tom Wolf. Come on, Tom. Open up Pennsylvania, Tom. Open it up. You know what’s going to happen? November 4th, they’ll open it up. You know that? They want to keep the numbers as bad as possible. Here’s the problem. The numbers are going to come out just before the election. So we have November 3rd, the numbers are going to come out. And Pennsylvania is a late voting state. You actually believe in going to a poll because you see all the shenanigans. No, you’re a late voting state. And all I can tell you is when I came here and I said this before, but when I came here, I promise you a lot of things. I’ve done much more than I promised you. You’ve had the best year you’ve ever had, and you’re going to have a better year next year. You damn well better vote for me, Pennsylvania. You better vote for me. Sleepy Joe Biden’s plan will crush America. And my plan, we’re going to crush the virus very quickly. It’s happening already. It’s happening. Almost 90% less mortality. You know, the mortality rate is at like 85. If you had it seven or eight months ago, it was not as good as if you have it now. And soon it’s going to be perfecto. And I said that the drug that they gave me, we’re going to be distributing it all over the country to hospitals and everything else, because I’ll tell you that sucker works. That’s my opinion. What do I know? But to me it works. And the people that did it. They’re phenomenal people. They’ve had great success with other vaccines and drugs. Just this week, we learned that another member of the Biden family is getting rich off connections to Joe. His son-in-law, just came out, big story, is cashing in on the China virus pandemic, just like Hunter. Where’s Hunter? Crashed in on China. What do you think when Hunter walks in and he walks out with a billion and a half dollars to manage for China. I said to a friend of mine, one of the biggest guys on Wall Street, “Does that ever happened?” He said, “I’m the biggest guy on Wall Street. That doesn’t happen for me.” 10 minutes, he had a billion and a half dollars. Maybe he’s not so stupid after all. To fight the China virus, we launched the largest mobilization since World War II. And we really should get credit for what we’ve done, because I’ll tell you Mike pats and all of these people, they have worked 24 hours around the clock. Our early and aggressive action saved as many as 2 million lives. Remember when they said, “No, no, no. You don’t want to ban China. Don’t ban China.” I did it in January. They were talking a month and a half later, we shouldn’t be doing it. He called me xenophobic. I said, “Joe, give me a definition of xenophobic, please.” He was unable to do that. We pioneered lifesaving therapies and reduced the fatality rate by 85%. I’m working with the FDA to make the antibody treatments I received. And everybody … we’re going to have them. They’re going to be shipped very soon. We’re working on an emergency use authorization, very complicated stuff. And the … Use authorization, very complicated stuff, and the FDA has never responded like they’ve responded to me. This could have taken years what we’ve done and we’ve done it in weeks. I know they came to me on one thing and they said, “Sir, well that will take approximately two and a half years.” I said, “No, it’s no good.” “When do you need it, sir?” “Next week? Tomorrow? How about tomorrow?” No, we’re pushing them hard. The FDA has been great. To everyone fighting to recover from the virus, I feel your pain because I felt your pain and we will beat this virus together. Who has had it? Who has had it here? Who’s had it? Yeah. A lot of people, a lot of people. Well, you’re the people I want to say hello to because you are right now immune. You are right now immune. Or they say that. You know, they hate to admit it because I had it. So in the old days they said, “Well, if you have it, you’re immune for life,” right? Once I got it, they give you four months. It’s anybody else but me, you’re immune for life. Through operation warp speed, which is incredible, we’ll have 100 million vaccine doses before the end of this year, 100 million, and the vaccine will end the pandemic once and for all. And remember this because I have the endorsement of, I think, every major law enforcement and minor law enforcement group in the country. We have a lot of Democrats that left their party and they came over, law enforcement people. I can almost tell you by looking. Look at this group over here. I know the law enforcement people. Nobody’s been better. We had all this surplus military equipment. Obama didn’t want to give it out because he said it looked too militaristic. I said, “No, I want to save lives. Okay?” It’s defensive equipment. I want to save lives. And we gave out hundreds of millions of… It was sitting in warehouses all over the country, military equipment, and we gave it out. But there’s nobody like the great men and women of law enforcement. Nobody. Look at that. Whoa. Whoa. See? They love you. See that? Wow. I didn’t expect that. That’s pretty good. That’s great. But this election is about law and order. You look at Portland. We keep saying to the governor, “Look, governor, Oregon.” I said, “Governor, let us go in. We’ll solve the problem in 30 minutes.” They don’t want to do that. You know, they’re supposed to ask you to come in. We did a great job in Minnesota, Minneapolis, except you know, instead of 10 days, they could have called us like two hours later. But they came in and they lined up and they were not socially distanced. They lined up. You saw that. They came in wearing black uniforms, 250, 000 and most expensive uniforms. I never saw so many computers on a helmet. But they went in and they had their tear gas and they had their pepper spray, which the other side doesn’t want us to use anymore. They said, “No, we don’t want to do that.” These people are a lot of bad people out there. You know, they’re anarchists, radical, left anarchists. Okay? So they came in. They came in. You saw it. There was one person. I said, “Where are the rest?” Then another one. Then another one. Then they started getting off buses, wherever. All of a sudden, you had one line, two line, and they just started moving forward. That was the end of the problem. It ended within 30 minutes. It was over. It was over. And we’ll do it wherever they want us. We’d love to go into Portland because those guys are bad news. You saw we sent in the U.S. Marshals, right? Because one man, horrible guy, shot somebody right through the head, shot him in the middle of the street. A guy who wasn’t hurting anybody. He killed him. Two days went by. Three days went by. I said, “Why the hell haven’t they arrested him?” And they knew who he was. And we sent in the U.S. Marshals. And in 15 minutes it was all over. That was the end of it. That was the end of it. Biden Harris and the Democrat party declared war on our police. Okay? And we’ve proudly received the endorsement of the National Association of Police Organizations, the National Troopers Coalition, the International Union of Police Associations, the Pennsylvania State Troopers Association. Wow. The Fraternal Order of Police including those in Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Scranton and virtually every single police organization that we know. And during the debate, I asked sleepy Joe, I said, “ive me one organization, law enforcement, that’s endorsing you.” And he couldn’t do it. Then Chris Wallace saved him. Then I said, remember I said, ” Sir, tell me, say the words law and order. Say it, Joe. Say it.” He couldn’t do it. He wouldn’t do it. He wouldn’t do it. Because you know what? Because he’d been run out of his party if he said the words law and order. Then I think at the end, didn’t he say like law, and order, and safety, and justice, and you know, all the stuff. No, no. Law and order. Say law and order, Joe. He couldn’t do it. So we’re joined tonight by some real warriors, warriors of a different type, political warriors. They’re okay too, right? And they’re friends of mine. They’re great people. Representative John Joyce. John, please. A guy has been around a long time and he fights like hell, G.T. Thompson. G.T., thank you. Great. Be careful with your election. I hear you’re only up 40 points, G.T. Another one is only up about 44 points, a really good friend of mine and he’s tough as hell, Mike Kelly. I say G.T., Mike, you need any help, I’ll come and help you. The say, “No, sir, we don’t really need help. Don’t worry about it.” A friend of mine and a great gentleman, and he was the first one that predicted that I was going to win this thing. I’ll tell you, former Congressman Lou Barletta. Thank you, Lou. Thank you, Lou. How are we doing, Lou? Are we doing okay? How do we compare to four years ago? Better. Okay, good. He said the right thing. Anyway, yeah, I think a lot better, because we produced. Again, four years ago. I said we’re going to do things. Now we’ve done them all plus additional things, I mean a lot of additional things. I never talked about Space Force. We did Space Force. You know, somebody did Space Force. That’s like a major achievement for four years. That’s one thing. That’s like one thing out of so many other things. So it’s one of those things, but I never used to talk about that. And former chair of the Pennsylvania Republican party, a friend of mine, the guy that knows more about Pennsylvania than any human being on earth, Rob Gleason. Rob, thank you. How are we doing Rob? Good? Okay, good. He said to me another group came down. They didn’t want his advice. They came down from Boston and they put events all over the place and he said, “You’re going to the wrong location.” Anyway, they ended up losing big. Right? But with us, we came to Rob. We say, where do you think the best places are? And we hit. And we agreed with you too. But Rob Gleason has been a fantastic friend. Thank you, Rob, very much for being here. I appreciate it. And with their help and your help, we are delivering for the American people like never before. Nobody’s ever done what we’ve done in three and a half years. No administration’s ever done this the first three and a half years. In my first three years in office, family income increased by $6,000 and that doesn’t include energy, which I think you could double it up. More than five times the gains in all eight years of the Obama administration. African American income grew nine times more than it did under the last administration. Think of it. African American income grew nine, not two, not three, nine times more, and these are out of the book. These numbers are out of the book. Real well for the bottom. 50% grew nearly twice as fast as it grew for the top. 1% Hispanic family net worth increased by 64% in a short period of time, 64. We added nearly 600,000 manufacturing jobs and we added 15,000 factories, and Obama said “You’ll never produce manufacturing jobs.” Remember? You need a magic wand. Well, we found the magic wand. We lifted 6.6 million Americans out of poverty including over 1 million African Americans, and more than 1.5 million Hispanic Americans. And we’re doing great with both groups and we love them. We love both groups. Thank you. Those are great numbers. After our tax cuts took effect, wages for the lowest income Americans grew twice as fast as those near the top. Think of that. You never hear that stuff. The big beneficiary were lowest income Americans. My policies have benefited those who need it the most. After the virus came in from China and we had to change. We had to do things. This came out. It was a sudden horrible thing. China should have never, ever let it happen. They should have never let it happen. We’ve seen the smallest economic contraction of any major western nation by far, and we’ve seen by far the fastest recovery of any nation. In the past five months, we’ve created a record 11.4 million jobs, that’s American jobs. That’s the fastest ever recorded. Job growth has been 23 times faster than the first five months. Think of this. For the first five months of the Obama Biden recovery, 23 times. We cut unemployment rate in half. Under Biden, it took 30 months to recover more than half the jobs lost to the crisis. We did it in five months. So we’re talking about numbers that nobody can even believe. Homebuilder confidence has reached an all time high. We’re in a pandemic. Reached an all-time high. Manufacturing optimism has doubled. Consumer confidence, which just came out, has surged nearly 20%, and small business confidence is now higher than any time in the entire decade proceeding my election. Think of that. And we’re rounding the turn on our pandemic. We’ve spent the last four years reversing the damage Joe Biden inflicted over the last 47 years. He made every bad deal in the book. And by the way, if you look at the H1N1, you know, he calls it the N1H1, right? I said, “No, no. H. Here’s the way you remember it, Joe. H comes before I.” And he goes, “The N1H1, whatever it’s called. What was his name again? Or the Senator? Maybe he was a governor.” Yeah, Romney. Romney. “Oh, that’s right. It was Romney.” It’s amazing. You know, amazing. And he gets away with that stuff. You only see it. You only see it on the internet. They never report it. They never report it. They should report it. They’re doing this country a great disservice by not reporting it. But Biden supported NAFTA, TPP, and China’s entry into the WTO, which is one of the worst things that ever happened to this country. For half a century, Biden twisted his blade into the heart of the American worker. He should not be asking for your vote. You should be begging for your forgiveness. He did a rotten job. Okay? Did a rotten job. For decades our politicians spent trillions and trillions of dollars rebuilding foreign nations, fighting foreign wars and defending foreign borders. But now we’re finally protecting our nation, rebuilding our cities, and we are bringing our jobs, our factories, and our troops back home to the USA where they belong. Almost done. Syria, we’re gone, except we kept the oil. Does anybody mind that I kept the oil? So we left some troops behind to keep the oil. With Iraq, we’re almost out. With Afghanistan, 19 years in Afghanistan, 19 years, and we’re really serving as policemen. It’s great to be policemen, but they got to have their own policemen. They got to do it themselves. But we’re, we’re bringing them home. We’re down to a very few number of soldiers. To save our auto industry, I withdrew from the last administration’s transpacific partnership disaster. It would have been a disaster. Would have destroyed your automobile industry and others. To defend our steel and aluminum workers, I imposed historic tariffs on dumped goods. Remember when they were dumping steel all over the place? You guys were getting killed. Saving those industries from total destruction. And frankly had the plague not came in from China, but now they’re doing well, anyway, had that not come in, you would have had a steel industry that would have been at a level that nobody’s ever seen before. But it came in, but you’re going to be there anyway in a short period of time, unless some stupid person comes along and raises your taxes by four times what they should be, which is what they want to do. I ended the NAFTA nightmare and signed the brand new USMCA into law. Everyone said that was going to be impossible to do. And I withdrew from the job killing Paris Climate Accord. So nice of them to tell us that we can’t use our energy. That was an accord. You know what that was going to? Destroy our country. That’s what that was going to do. If you look at what has happened over the last very short period of time, the progress that this nation has made, you’re not even going to believe it and you’re going to see it. And you would have seen it had the plague not come in because it was all happening. We were at every single record, but now we’re getting close anyway. The jobs are all coming back and the market is almost going to be topping the market from before the plague. And it’s pretty amazing. I will tell you. Biden has vowed to rejoin this horrible agreement, a death sentence for your state’s energy industry, The Paris Accord. It’s a terrible thing. Unlike Biden, I know my job is to represent Pennsylvania, not Paris. We’re representing Pennsylvania, not Paris. Got a lot of nice people. They can represent Paris. I took the toughest ever action to confront China’s rampant theft of American jobs. You know that. We charged them so much. We gave a lot of the money to our farmers, $28 billion to our farmers because our farmers were targeted. Everybody get your money. They did better without even growing anything, to be honest. But we got it from China, $28 billion, and we had a lot left over that went into the treasury of the United States. To defend American workers, earlier today I also signed an order to crack down on Chinese counterfeiters and merchants who sell their fake products all over the United States. They put the name Tiffany, Tiffany. It’s got the blue box, everything. Tiffany, Tiffany, Tiffany. Isn’t that wonderful? But it wasn’t made by Tiffany. Biden will eliminate my tariffs on China. He’s already said he’s going to take the tariffs off China. There goes your steel industry. There goes your aluminum industry. That goes everything. Allowing them to plunder without consequence. The one constant in Biden’s platform is surrender. He surrenders. He surrenders whether it’s a China, whether it’s Cuba. How about Cuba? How about the deal they made with Cuba? How bad was that one? I ended it. That’s why both China and the far left are desperate for a Biden win because he will surrender our jobs to China. China will own the United States if that sleepy guy gets the position. Okay? And you can forget about Pennsylvania. And you know, don’t also forget, your streets will be surrendered to the mob. You know, Republican areas are great. They’re doing great. The crime is at record lows, everything else. These are the Democrats, super liberal Democrat areas. Unlike sleepy Joe Biden, I will never abandon our nation and I will never abandon its values. My goal is not to make friends in the D.C. swamp. My goal is to fight for you and fight for your family. In 2017, I proudly signed a historic executive order making it official government policy to buy American and hire American. My opponent has put forward a radical plan to eliminate U.S. borders by implementing catch and release programs. And I ended. You know what catch and release is? You catch a murderer, you catch a rapist coming across our border, and you release him. Catch, catch him and release him. And you say, “I’m sorry. Three years from now, please come back for a court case.” Nobody comes back. Impose- Please come back for a court case. Nobody comes back. Imposing deadly sanctuary cities and suspending all removals. They don’t want any removals. This is what Biden agreed to with crazy Bernie Sanders. When you have people that are in this country illegally, even if they’re murderers, if they’re rapists, no matter what they are, you can’t remove them. We’ve removed tens of thousands of people including MS-13. It would mean the total nullification of US borders overwhelming every city and town in America, and especially in a place like Pennsylvania. Biden wins, your borders are gone, which means your healthcare is gone, the middle class is gone and your safety is gone. Other than that, you’ll be doing very nicely. Under my leadership, we achieved the most secure border in US history and we’re finishing that wall. It’s going to be built very soon. It’s going to be finished. We’re going to have the greatest celebration. That was a tough one. That was a tough one. Remember they said, “We don’t need a wall.” They wanted drones, drones flying around looking at the people pouring across the border. They wanted drones. They wanted modern technology. You know what I’ve said often, right? There were two things that will always be around in a thousand years, in 2000 years, all new computers, all new everything. You come up with a new computer. You come up with a new chip. Three days later, it’s obsolete. I would not want to be in that business, but there are two things, a wall and a wheel right? A wall and a wheel. In a thousand years, 2000 years, it’s going to be here. We invested $2.5 trillion in the US military and launched the first new branch of the United States Armed Forces in more than 75 years, Space Force. For our great vets. We pass VA choice and VA accountability. Nobody thought would ever get that done. We killed the leader of ISIS, Al-Baghdadi, and we took down 100% of the ISIS caliphate. And when I took over, that caliphate was all over the place. It was a mess. We took down the world’s number one terrorist and the mass murder of many American troops, many troops, many people all over the world. Qasem Soleimani is dead. Thank you. He’s dead. I withdrew from the last administration’s disaster, Iran nuclear deal. One of the worst deals I’ve ever seen. That’s John Kerry, the guy was totally incompetent. That guy didn’t know what the hell he was doing. He gave him $150 billion, 1.8 billion in cash for nothing. I kept my promise, recognize the true capital of Israel and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem. I also recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. 52 years, I’ve been trying to get that. And instead of endless war, we’re forging peace in the Middle East, you see the deals we made? I actually got nominated for a Nobel Peace prize. The press didn’t cover it, but that’s okay. The press didn’t cover it. I got nominated for three Nobel Peace prizes. I did more in 47 months in Joe Biden did in 47 years and that’s true. Now Biden is pushing the most far left agenda ever put forward by a presidential nominee. He’s going to ruin your energy. He’s going to ruin your state. The Biden plan would destroy social security and destroy protections for preexisting conditions because there’s no money. Biden’s running mates sponsored a bill to outlaw private health insurance. We have 180 million people with great private plans. They want to keep it that way. They’re going to outlaw. They’re going to get rid of them. Biden vowed to terminate our travel bans on Jihadist regions and surge refugee admissions by more than 700%. he agreed to this. He said, “That’s okay. Let them come in. I got the ban right? Remember the ban. Remember who’s a big deal. I got the ban. I said, “If it’s okay, we have unfriendly countries. If it’s all right with you, they’re not coming into our country. I got the ban. We won in the Supreme court, five to four. I got the ban.” He wants to give up the ban. He wants to let people pour into our country. 700% increase opening the flood gates to radical Islamic terrorism. I don’t want to speak too much. Made of wood. This is real wood. I don’t want to speak too much, but you haven’t seen too many things happening lately have you? He’ll ban school choice, charter schools and Pennsylvania opportunity scholarships. In a second term, I will provide school choice to every parent in America. It’s so important. A vote for Republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs, and a limitless future for all Americans and in conclusion and I love being back with you in Pennsylvania. So many incredible memories really. So many. What a night that was. Remember that night? Donald Trump has won the commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Donald Trump. Remember how late? They just didn’t want to call it. They didn’t want to call it. I said, “Call it already.” We were at 98%. We were substantially ahead. If I lost every single vote, we still won. It took him like till two o’clock in morning before they called it. In the meantime, Wisconsin came in and Michigan came in, but they just refused to call Pennsylvania. They just couldn’t. Remember them crying and they were all stirred up. Over the next four years. We’ll make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world. And we’ll end our reliance on China once and for all. That’s already happening. We’ll hire more police, increased penalties for assault on law enforcement, and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities that people don’t want. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech and the right to keep and bear arms, your second amendment. We’ll strike down terrorists to threaten our citizens, and we will keep America out of endless foreign ridiculous wars. We will maintain America’s unrivaled military mind and we will ensure peace through strength. And by the way, we’ve rebuilt our military. I told you $2.5 trillion. We have weapons and equipment, the likes of which no country has ever seen before. We are the envy of Russia. We are the envy of China. We are the envy of everybody. There is no country that has what we have. And I will tell you when I first came here, one of our generals highly overrated said to me, “Sir, we have no ammunition.” That’s where we started. And now we have the greatest weapons anywhere in the world. And just hope to God, we never have to use them. We will then surprise medical building, require price transparency which is already signed January 1, it kicks in, and further reduce the costs of prescription drugs. And I’m talking about 50, 60, 70, 80% because of what I’ve done with favored nations, getting the lowest price Mike, the whole world. We’re going down. We’re taking these nations. They pay a fraction of what we pay. I said, “Nope, whatever they pay, I want to pay.” Why are we paying more than any other nation? We’re the highest. We’re going down to match the lowest. The drug companies don’t love me too much just in case you haven’t heard. We will strongly protect Medicare and social security. We’ll always protect patients with pre existing conditions. America will land the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars, and we’re very close. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our school. We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history and always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, in God we trust. For years, you had a president who apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the great people of Pennsylvania. It’s very important. So get your friends. Most important election we’ve ever had. Get your family, get your neighbors and get out and vote. You got to get out and vote like you’d never voted before. Places that we won like Erie. Places that we won, you got to get out and vote because from Erie to Easton, from Pittsburgh to Harrisburg and from Allentown to right here in Johnstown, we stand on the shoulders of Pennsylvania patriots who gave their blood, sweat, and tears for this beloved nation. This is the state where our founding fathers declared American independence. Think of what you have in Pennsylvania. Who can say that? This is it. What you’ve done here, what the history of this incredible place, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, think of what you’ve done. It’s where the army weathered its brutal winter at Valley Forge and General George Washington… Don’t worry. His statues are not coming down. Led his man on a daring mission across the Delaware and where our nation was saved by the heroes of Gettysburg. This is the place where generations of tough, strong Pennsylvania workers, mine the coal, work the railroads, and forge the steel, that made America into the greatest and most powerful nation in the history of the world. And you have seen nothing yet. Wait till you see what we’re doing. We are making our country greater than ever before. Proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. And when you’re great Congressman to come to see me, right? It’s great. What a group of warriors. I don’t know with them. I’m not sure I can handle that group, but when they come in to see me in the Oval Office, they say, “Mr. President, Pennsylvania is not used to winning this much. We got to slow it down a little bit.” And I’ll say, “Mike, I’m sorry. Mike, you tell the rest of them Mike. We’re not going to slow it down at all.” Pennsylvania wants to win more than anybody in this country wants to win. Pennsylvania is going to win. We’re never going to stop. We’re going to keep on winning. We’re going to win so much you’re going to love every moment of that era. And you know what? You lost long enough. I can tell you that. Many years where your factories in your plants left because we have stupid leadership. Don’t kid yourself. You lost for a long time. And now you’re winning and you’re winning like never before. Open it up Governor. Open it up. Because we’re one movement, one family, one people, and one glorious nation under God. And together with the incredible people of Pennsylvania, we have made America wealthy again. We have made America strong again. We have made America proud again, and we will make America safe again and we will make America great again. Thank you very much Pennsylvania. Thank you. Get out and vote. Vote, vote, vote. Thank you very much. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you very much, everybody. Hello, Des Moines. Oh, it’s been a good time we’ve had in Des Moines. I even brought a hat. They said, “Sir, it is so windy out there.” I said, “Well, my hair is very powerful. It’s very strong. It can handle it.” But I bought it just in case. It may get pretty bad. But it’s pretty windy. So thank you all very much. And I’m thrilled to be back in the American Heartland with thousands of loyal, hardworking Iowa patriots. And 20 days from now, we’re going to win this state. We’re going to win four more years in the White House. We’re going to keep it going. And I must tell you, I’ve just looked. The poll just came out. We’re up six. Okay. Big deal. Didn’t we win by 11 or something. We’re up six. And if I’m up six, nobody has ever done for Iowa and the farm belt and the farmers and all, no more estate taxes, no more anything. I saved ethanol. Ethanol is saved. For me to only be up six, I’m a little bit concerned. I’ll tell you that. There’s nobody’s going to do for Iowa what I did for Iowa. We’ve just learned through, explosive documents, published by a very fine newspaper, The New York Post, that Joe Biden has been blatantly lying about his involvement in his son’s corrupt business dealings. And this is a big smoking gun. The newly uncovered emails reveal that a top executive from the highly questionable Ukrainian company, it’s an energy company which paid Hunter at least $50,000 a month, but it’s now looking like it could be $183,000 a month. That’s a lot of money. Would anybody in this audience take it? I’ll take it. We’ll take it. Despite the fact that he had absolutely no experience, knew nothing about energy, wrote to Hunter arranging for a meeting to meet with Vice President Joe Biden. I’ve been saying this for a long time with that family. The same Ukrainian energy executive even sent Hunter an email saying, “We urgently need your advice on how you could use your influence.” In other words, Hunter was being paid for access to his Vice President father, who was specifically put in charge of Ukraine and Russia. How about the Russia hoax? It turned out that they were the ones that did the Russia hoax. It was them. No collusion. No collusion. These emails show that Biden’s repeated claim that he has never spoken to Hunter about his business dealings were a complete lie. It was a total lie. He lied to you over and over because he’s trying to cover up a massive pay for play scandal at the heart of his vice presidency. And everybody knows it. Everybody in Washington knows it. We’ve known it for a long time. The fact is there was never an administration more corrupt than the Obama Biden administration. There was never. Never. Just weeks ago, Joe stood before the American people in a presidential debate and told you that these claims had been totally discredited and that his son did nothing wrong. But now that turns out to be a total lie. Now we can see clearly that Biden is a corrupt politician who shouldn’t even be allowed to run for the presidency. I was pressing Joe Biden to tell the truth because the corrupt lame stream media, right back there, all those cameras right back there, they’re corrupt. And they refuse to write the story. There wasn’t one time in almost four years during my presidency, during the greatest political scandal in U.S. history, a witch hunt, a horrible, horrible, disgusting witch hunt that should never, ever happen to another presidency again, and people should pay for the crimes they committed. Which turned out to me at total illegal hoax that false and libelous stories every day, false and libelous stories, and they knew they were false, too. They knew they were false. They were never taken down by Twitter or Facebook or the mainstream media. Never once. Yet with Biden today, they take negative posts down almost before they even go up. They’re trying to protect them. They’re trying to protect Biden. They take them down. And I was just getting off that magnificent plane behind us, Air Force One. And I had heard, and I just don’t know this for a fact, but they say Kayleigh McEnany, you know Kayleigh, right? Kayleigh McEnany. Good Kayleigh. She’s so great. She’s incredible. They closed down her account. She’s the White House Press Secretary. Because she’s reporting the truth, they closed down her account. So let’s see what’s going to happen. And did you hear the news? Bruce Ohr is finally out of the Department of Justice. Bruce Ohr. Him and his wonderful wife, Molly. She wrote all this stuff. And then he goes and he works at Department of Justice and he took it, didn’t he bring it to the FBI? The wife writes that she gets paid a lot of money. Bruce Ohr is finally out of the Department of Justice. That’s good. Couple of years too late, that’s all. He should be not only in the Department of Justice outbox, he should be someplace else, okay? Eight months after his alleged meeting with the Burisma executives. So these Burisma, Burisma, they say, pronounce it Burisma, a real beautiful company, Vice President Joe Biden went to Ukraine and threatened to withhold $1 billion in aid if they did not fire the prosecutor that was investigating his son and the company that his son worked for. That’s Burisma. The documents also show that before one of Joe’s trips to Ukraine, Hunter emailed his business partner saying his lucrative contract should begin now. Think of that. Should begin now, right now. It’s got to begin. The whole thing is so incredible. Here’s a guy, look, let’s just put it in simple language. He got thrown out of the military. That’s unfortunate. He didn’t have a job for a long time. His father becomes Vice President, and he’s making millions and millions and millions of dollars a year. Think of it. No, think of it. Think of it. It’s like the Hillary stuff, the crooked Hillary. And it’s the crooked Joe. You know, when a Democrat voter here in Iowa asked Joe last year, you remember, if his son raked in money in exchange for providing access, Joe pulled that man a damn liar. “You’re a damn liar.” Kid’s making millions of dollars. He had nothing. He didn’t have a job. Thrown out of the military, sadly, but thrown out of the military. And he knew nothing about energy. He knew nothing about investments. Knew nothing about China. How about he walked away a billion and a half dollars to manage for China? They don’t do that with the most brilliant people on Wall Street. Vice President Biden, you owe the people of America and apology because it turns out you are a corrupt politician. Okay? Joe Biden must immediately release all emails, meetings, phone calls, transcripts, and records related to his involvement in his family’s business dealings, influence panelings around the world, including China and including Russia, including Russia. Hunter raked in a fortune from China while Joe Biden was giving China all of our jobs. We know where they came from, Iowa and plenty of other places, but they came from Iowa. He was giving them. They were taking our jobs. They were taking our factories. They were taking everything. They were taking our wealth. And I gave you $28 billion. Say, “Thank you very much, President Xi.” It came right out of China. And because of that, everybody’s happy in Iowa. I just hope you remember that on November 3rd. Hope you remember. Nobody else would have done it. Nobody else would have done it. The Biden family treated the vice presidency as a for-profit corporation, flying around the globe, collecting millions of dollars from China and Ukraine and Russia and other countries. In fact, the wife of the mayor of Moscow gave Hunter Biden a check for $3.5 million in cash while his father gave away the store to Russia, including Crimea. Remember Crimea? The Bidens got rich while America got robbed. By contrast, and this is so true and so easily true, and I’m so proud of it in so many ways, I’d given up billions of dollars to serve as your President and it’s my greatest honor of a lifetime. It’s so true. Where’s my hat? I ran for President because I could not sit back any longer and watch the terrible injustices being done to the American people. And it’s true. And by the way, before the China plague came in, we had the greatest economy in the history of the world, and now it’s going right back there. Our stock market is very close to a number that was even higher. Does everybody have your 401k ready? Because it’s going through the roof. We’re going to have the best year we’ve ever had, and we’re going to have tax cuts not tax increases. They want to increase your taxes. They want to increase your taxes so they can spend it on the green new deal. That’s another beauty. I can not sit idly by and watch career politicians like Joe Biden continue bleeding this country dry. And that’s what it is. You know, you can say whatever you want. You can say whatever you want, but when you have a kid that follows his father, and by the way, take a look at his brother, his brother, all of- … who is his father? And by the way, take a look at his brother. His brother, all of a sudden is building a big housing development in Iraq. “Have you ever built a development before?” “No, I haven’t.” Take a look at the whole family, it’s a corrupt family. Joe Biden, personifies the selfless and corrupt globalist who got rich and powerful at your expense. Take a look at the people that are funding his campaign, people assumed that they’d be funding my campaign, I don’t want them, we don’t want them, we never needed them, we don’t want them. But they betrayed American workers, disparaged American values and crushed our middle-class. For decades, Biden and his cronies laughed while they shipped millions of your jobs to their friends in foreign countries, in countries that you’ve never even heard of. They live behind gated walls and they flooded your communities with illegal immigration, deadly drugs, MS-13 savages that assault, rape, and murder innocent Americans. They forced our fellow citizens to live in crumbling inner cities while they spent trillions of dollars on never ending foreign wars, they just never ended, but we’re bringing all our soldiers back home, you know that, we’ve been doing it for a long time. And it’s not easy, the military industrial complex, not the easiest thing, but we’re bringing them back home. We’re almost finished in Afghanistan, coming in, we’re dealing… We’re down to a small number coming home by the end of the year, hopefully the end of the year, shortly thereafter. In Syria, we’re out, totally out. And by the way, we crushed, before I did this, we crushed 100% of the ISIS caliphate, 100%, we crushed 100%. We have the greatest military in the world, and by the way, we have built the greatest military in the world. So, I just tell you from Iowa, you’re a very powerful state, politically, you’re a big state to me, big in your heart, but you have a tremendous influence and a tremendous power and you’ve never let me down, you just came in and we won by so much. They say if a Republican wins by one point… I think I won by 11, right? 11. That was early in the night, remember that? They said, “Donald Trump has won the state of Iowa.” Then they said, “Man, he went by 11 points, what’s going on?” That was just the beginning. Then we won Ohio, we won Ohio by eight points, I said, “What’s going on?” It’s one thing you want to say, but when you wouldn’t buy a lot, and that was the beginning of something. And I’ll tell you what, we have more enthusiasm now than we ever did four years ago, that really is true. And we have great poll numbers, although you see a lot of the fake poll numbers they’ll do anything they can to call suppression pools. There they go. Look at the red lights, they start to go off as I start to put… In one way they want the ratings, in another way they don’t want to have the ratings and you’re telling CNN that they’re a fraud in their broadcasting. That was one of the greatest evenings ever. There were those who say it was the most exciting evening in the history of television, highest rated evening in the history of television. And, you know what? The election we have coming up on November 3rd is actually more important. In 2016, you voted to fire the failed and decrepit political class and you elected an outsider as your president, and I finally put America first, it’s called Make America Great Again. It’s windy out here. If you can wear the hat, I can wear the hat. Should I take off the tie or not? What do you think? I don’t know. Maybe, yes? Oh, that feels so much better, that feels better, that feels good. Now, we can all just relax and have a good time. No, but it’s great to be with you. Seriously, we’ve had a great history here together, what we’ve done for you, and what we’ve done for the farmers, and what we’ve done for everything. Two weeks ago, you had the largest order of corn in the history of our country, right? Two weeks ago, you had the largest order of soybeans in the history of our country, and the largest order of beef, but you know why? Because China wants to keep me happy, that’s why. It was from China, because they know what they’ve done to us should never have been allowed. They could have stopped it, they didn’t stop it, they should have stopped it. The only reason I’m your president is because the previous administration did a poor job, so poor, in fact, that I said, “I’m going to run for president.” And you know what? If they did a good job, I wouldn’t have run. And if they did a good job, I guess, I wouldn’t have won, when you think, I wouldn’t have run and I wouldn’t have won. But they were so bad, and it turns out there was so totally corrupt. We did not come this far to overcome this much and fight this hard only to surrender our country back to the deprived Washington swamp. When I would say, “Drain the swamp,” I used to say it, “Drain the swamp,” and people liked it, I hated the expression, I hated it. I just said, “This is a hokey expression.” And I put it on one speech the place went crazy, I said, “I’m starting to like that expression.” Then I put it in another speech and they went crazy, I said, “I really like it.” But when I said drain the swamp, I had no idea the swamp was that dirty, that disgusting, and that deep, it’s true. If I don’t sound like a typical Washington politician, it’s because I’m not a politician, thank God. And I don’t want to insult our great politicians because you have some great ones with us tonight. But if I don’t always play by the rules of Washington and Washington establishment, it’s because I was elected to fight for you harder than… And I’ll tell you what, I fight for you harder than any president has ever fought for anyone, it’s not easy. But I love it because we’re making tremendous progress. And the fact is that, no administration in their first three and a half years has ever done as much as this administration has done, you take a look at the last ones. And it’s amazing because they challenge you on everything, they never even challenge me on that statement. I make that statement all the time, they just stand there and they say, “.” They grit their, they say, “He’s right.” “We might hate him, but,” they say, “he’s right.” Right now I’m fighting to eradicate the virus, rebuild the economy, and save our country from the radical left, and that’s exactly what we’re doing. As a candidate, Joe Biden has made yet another corrupt bargain in exchange for his party’s nomination. He has handed control to the socialists, and Marxists, and the lunatic left-wing fringe that are really running that party, he’s not running it. Let’s face it, Joe is shot, okay? Whether you like it or not. We can all be nice. It’s going to be my turn someday, it’s even going to be your turn someday, my friends, someday. But you know when it is your turn, you can’t be president. One thing I’ve learned, President Xi of China, he’s a 100%, Putin of Russia, 100%, Kim Jong-un… By the way, whatever happened to that war we were supposed to be in? Kim Jong-un of North Korea, 100%. These people are sharp and they’re smart, Joe has lost it. In his best day, he wasn’t a smart man, everybody he knows that. But Joe has gone. If he wins, the radical left will be running the country, they’re addicted to power, and God help us if they get it. We’ll never be the same country and we will never be able to recover. And we are on a basis… And I’ll tell you something, the country was coming together. I was telling a very, very, actually a very good reporter today, that our country was coming together because we were having such success that I was being called by people that normally I wouldn’t be speaking to too much, they don’t want me, I don’t want them. But we had the best employment numbers in history, African-American, Hispanic American numbers, women, Asian, everything, high school diploma, without high school diploma, colleges, PhDs, we had the best numbers in every category, 160 million jobs, we were never even close to that, we were at 160 million jobs. And it was all coming together, people let’s get together, let’s talk. It’s like splitting up the riches, really, and in a positive way, splitting up the riches. And what happened is, we then got hit with the plague and now it’s back to the drawing boards, but we’re going to have a strong V the quarter, the third quarter is going to be incredible when you see the numbers. Not that I know anything, because I don’t want to give you inside information because I don’t have it. They’ll say, “He’s giving away inside information,” they are sick. But wait till you see the third quarter numbers, and it’s going to be right before the election, before the November 3rd, although a lot of people will have voted by that time, get out and vote, you got to get out and vote. But we were really coming together because that’s… Look, ultimately, we want to come together, everybody come together. And we were really coming together and then we got hit by this horrible situation, could have been stopped. China stopped it from going into the rest of China, but they didn’t stop it from coming out and going to Europe, and the United States, and the rest of the world, 188 countries. So, we’re now putting it together. We had it done and now we’re doing it again, and next year will be even stronger than last year. Last year was the best year we’ve ever had, and this coming year will be even better than last year. Unless somebody comes along and says, “Let’s quadruple your taxes,” which is what they want to do. They want to raise your taxes. They want to go with this ridiculous Green New Deal, which by the way, their original price, a hundred trillion, you couldn’t do it for that. If we did great every year for a hundred years, everything was perfect, right? No nothing, no recessions, no anything, you couldn’t make a hundred trillion dollars. These people are crazy, and they actually mean it. So, we’re going to get it going to a level that nobody can ever turn course on us, nobody can ever change. I tell the story for years as a student of economies, I just love it, I love watching it, I love doing it, and I love seeing the results because the results have been so incredible. But as a student, I used to hear for years, for 10 years, 2019 China… Because look, let’s face it, China is 1.4 billion people, we’re 325, not including illegal immigrants that are in the country, frankly. And we don’t even know what that number… I said, “How many do we have?” “We have no idea, sir.” Well, I have an idea… By the way, our Southern border is now stronger than it’s ever been. But we have 325, 330 million people. But for years I heard that China will overtake us as the world’s largest economy in the year 2019, you’ve all heard it, I think, right? Yes? He’s a very smart looking guy, you’re loaded with money, I bet, look, that’s why he’s in the front row. He’s in the front row and he didn’t have to stand there for three days to get there, I could tell this guy. But, right? 2019 that China was going to overtake. Well, you go back six months, seven months, not only weren’t they overtaking we were beating them by leaps and bounds and getting bigger and bigger, and growing and growing, and taxing them and taxing them, and taking in billions and billions in tariffs. And when they targeted Iowa and the farmers of this country, and ranchers, and others, I said, “No, you can’t do that, no, you can’t.” And I put a 25% tariff on everything and I gave a lot of the money… I don’t want to say it too loudly, 28 billion, I gave you 16 and 12. I said to Sonny Perdue, Secretary of Agriculture, great guy, loves… He knows more about farms. I said, “Sonny, what’s the number?” He said, “Two years ago, sir, 12 billion they hit us 4. And last year, 16 billion.” I said, “That’s okay. We’re going to put a 25% tariff, the farmers are going to get 12 billion and then they’re going to get 16 billion, okay? And we’re going to give that money to our farmers.” And that got our farmers even. In fact, I shouldn’t tell you this because they don’t like this, but some of the farmers were making more money the way that Iowa was doing than by working their asses off, all right? They were very, very happy. But no, we took care of our farmers, no other president is going to do that. No other… That’s why China got away with all of these stuff for years. And we had plenty of money left over after the $28 billion, it went into the US treasury. But they got away with it because they had threatened a president like Obama, we’re going to target your farmers, we’re going to target the middle of our country, and Obama would say, “We better not get involved.” I said differently. I said, “If you do it then what we’re going to do is we’re going to tariff your goods away, give a lot of that money to the people that you’re targeting.” And the thing that most impresses me about Iowa, Nebraska, and a lot of other States, if you look… By the way, Minnesota was so great, all of them, every one of them, Wisconsin was incredible. They never came to me and said, “Sir, you can’t let this happen. They’ll stop re-ordering, they’re not ordering from us.” They never said it. You know what they said, “The president is right, at some point we have to put up a stand.” And I didn’t hear one even from fake CNN, they put people on television that said, “I know it’s not good, but the president is right.” You did the right thing. Because otherwise, it puts me in a bad negotiating position, you can’t really negotiate, it’s tough. I’ll never forget that about the farmers, it’s incredible. The other thing I won’t forget… You don’t mind if I go off script, this stuff is… Enough with crazy Hunter Biden and making millions of dollars a day, he made it because of his great intellect. No, but you know the other thing… Where’s Hunter? Is Hunter here tonight, by the way? Hunter, congratulations on making a lot of money last year. The other thing I remember in the White House, we had 36 farmers come to see me, I’ll never forget it. And they were getting hit really hard, this was two and a half years ago, early. And they came in to see me, almost all farmers, and they said, “Sir, we’re hurting, but you’re doing the right thing, sir.” I’ll never forget this meeting, it’s early… I’ve pictures of it. Many from Iowa, but from other states, but many from Iowa. And I never saw… Because everyone’s always asking me for money, “I want money here. I want… Countries want money.” Our so-called allies are always asking for money, ” Please defend us.” Even though… And then they rip us off on trade. We defend them and then they rip us off in trade, they’re always asking for money. So, the farmers are in, and I said to them, “You know what I’m going to do? I’m going to do a big thing, I’m going to get you a lot of money and I’m going to do for tariffs, and I’m going to do this to…” This is very early on in the strategy. “And I’m going to subsidize you guys, you’re going to be so happy.” And I used a terrible word. They said, “Sir, may I speak?” “Yes, you can. What do you want to say?” “We don’t want subsidy, sir. All we want is a level playing field, we don’t want anything. All we want…” It’s true, right? It’s true. I never heard that. Most people, they don’t care, call it subsidy, call it, give me cash, just give me money, the farmer said, “We…” And by the way, I could see there was a chill in the room when I mentioned that word. I said, “Did I say something wrong?” The farmers are unbelievable, they’re the heart of this nation. They said, “We don’t want subsidy.” I’ll never forget it. “Sir, we don’t want subsidy, we don’t want that. We just want a level playing field, sir. We’ll beat anybody. We want a level…” And it’s to this day… I tell that story all the time, because I don’t hear that, most people they don’t care you can call it anything you want, you call subsidy, you call it anything you want. I just think you people are incredible, okay? That’s it. Enough of that or I’m going to make him cry, and he hasn’t tried in 40 years, that guy. One of the most important issues for Iowa is the whole thing that happened with ethanol, they were killing ethanol, and Joe Biden has vowed to abolish fossil fuels, he supports all of the outside… This crusade to eliminate gas powered cars, and his running mate sponsors the insane… She’s the most liberal… By the way, did Mike Pence beat her ? The expression in boxing or as my friend, Dana would say, UFC, if that were a fight, they would have stopped it, right? We love Mike Pence and he loves Iowa too, he loves Iowa, he just left. The Biden-Harris platform will demolish Iowa ethanol, you know that, wiping out the entire industry. And we fought hard for it, we went through the whole thing where we had no demand because of the pandemic and we all fought hard to keep it going and keep the ethanol going. And we did the 12 months… I did 12 months, remember it was eight months, I said, “Why not 12?” And they couldn’t give me a very good answer. But I made it year round and 15%, right? Up from the 10, 15%, and it’s great stuff. And when the market comes back, which is coming back, but in the meantime you have inexpensive gasoline, that’s not so bad, right? There’s nobody who ever thought they’d see gasoline with a two in the front of it and less, and we’ve saved all of our energy jobs. And whether we like it or not, when we are having problem with energy, I called Russia, and I called Saudi Arabia, and they reduced production by more than 10 million barrels a day and our entire energy was saved all over the world, frankly, they’re not doing it for us, but they’re doing it for, let’s say, everybody. And we have an incredible country and we saved our energy industry, our energy jobs, and we are energy independent, and it’s a beautiful thing. And by the way, I also made a little promise most of you won’t understand, for those people in the ethanol world, you can use the pumps, okay? Do you understand that? You can use the pumps. In other words, you don’t have to go out and spend hundreds of millions of dollars on new pumps. Because with the additional ethanol, the additional power, some people say, “Oh, make them buy new pumps.” No, I don’t want you to buy new pumps, you don’t have to. So, for those people that understood what I just said, you know what I’m talking about, right? Using the pumps, that’ll be okay. To defend our rights in our constitution, I nominated Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the United States Supreme Court. Right? And I’ll tell you, I don’t mind running against sleepy Joe, but I wouldn’t want to run against her right now. She has to promise… Please promise me, Amy, you’ll never run. Now, she’s been great, she’s so outsmarting these people with bad intention. You look at some of the questions that are being asked and you… It’s so obvious, these are not great chess players. Let’s face it, they’re not great, but they’re horrible, just horrible, nasty, and she handles it like nothing. She’s a great intellect. And one of the reasons she is a highly respected professor who’s been teaching for many years, I said she was the single greatest student that he’s ever had, and that sold me. I believe in that kind of thing, it’s called intelligence, I believe in intelligence. But I just want to… I haven’t spoken to her in a few days, I want to just say that we made the right choice, right? With Amy. And speaking about making the right choice, you made the right choice a long time ago with a man named Senator Chuck Grassley. And you made the right choice and you’re going to do it again, I hope, because she’s great, Joni Ernst. And they’re right now in Washington fighting to confirm our great new justice, our future justice of the United States Supreme Court. Joni has been fantastic and she’s been for Iowa values for a long time. She’ll call me, “Sir, can we do this?” Nobody called me more on ethanol than Joni and Chuck. In fact, I used to duck their calls, “Just tell him I’m not in. I can’t take it anymore, Joni.” But that’s what a good Senator is, they want to keep your state going, they want to keep our country going, they love our country, they love our state that they represent. So, Joni Ernst, you got to get her in. And Chuck Grassley, we don’t have to worry about him, he’ll be around forever, he’s great. You know what I love about Chuck Grassley? He’s got that voice, that great voice. Even when he’s being nice, he sounds like the toughest guy, right? And he’s being nice. And he looked at Comey, remember? The corrupt FBI director. And he looks at Comey, corrupt guy, and he just said, “Did you leak?” And Comey joked, “Yes, I did.” He said in the House, and let’s see what happens to him. But I’ll never forget Chuck Grassley, and he didn’t mean it to be mean, he just sort of got that rough voice. “Did you leak?” “What? Yes, I gave it to my college professor friend from Columbia.” Remember that? We love Chuck, what a piece of work he is. If Democrats win, they will pack the Supreme Court with radical left judges who will shred our second amendment. And believe me, if they win, your second amendment is gone, okay? They’ll empower violent mobs and shield deadly criminals and terrorists, it’s very simple. Joe Biden refuses to even answer questions on packing the Supreme Court. How about this? They go up to him, “Do you want to pack the court?” “I’m not going to answer that question.” You know why? Because they don’t ask it if he doesn’t… Me, it would be like… Forget it. But they say, “Are you going to pack the court, sir?” “I’m not going to answer that because I don’t want to say.” “Oh, okay, good. Next question.” No, can you believe it? This is the essence of our country, we can’t allow this to happen. And the other thing is, they don’t ask the second. I put up a list of 45, great, brilliant conservative, in our case, justices that go by the constitution as written et cetera, okay? So… He’s got to put up the name of justices or judges, whoever he’d pick to become a justice of the Supreme Court, he’s not doing that, they’re not asking that question, they don’t ask. Did you see the NBC thing last week where they had an NBC town hall? It was designed for a child, okay? When I get in, they ask me things that nobody ever even contemplated could be thought of. This guy, they’re asking him these questions, nobody can believe it. In fact, NBC took a lot of heat, they took a lot of heat. Biden’s agenda would be a catastrophe for Iowa seniors, everybody knows that. For years, Biden tried to cut social security and Medicare, do you remember that? You do know he wanted to cut your social security and your Medicare. Now, Biden… … cut your social security and your Medicare. Now Biden is pledging mass amnesty and federal healthcare for illegal aliens, decimating Medicare and destroying your Social Security. And the problem is we all have a heart. I say it all the time. I’d love to take care of everybody all over the world. The problem is our country can’t afford it. And if you start saying we’re going to give free education. We’re going to give you Medicare. We’re going to give you healthcare. We’re going to give you everything. Our country will be flooded with millions and millions of people that are going to come from all over the world. They will decimate our country. You can’t do it. Biden cares more about illegal aliens that he does for your senior citizens. It’s true. I remember when they asked the question at the debate where the Democrats were up there. You had all these Democrats, they started off with 26. And in fact, I said, “There’s no way they pick Kamala because she treated him worse than anybody else and her poll numbers were dropping like a rock, right. But they asked who is going to give money, healthcare to illegal aliens? And they all raised their hand. Remember Joe, he’s looking around. He didn’t understand the question. He didn’t. At least he has an excuse because has no clue what the hell they’re asking. But do you remember his position? He was like this. Their hands are all up. We’re going to give all our money away. Forget about all your people. That’s a big crowd by the way. Look at that. Show it. Show it please. Turn those cameras, please. That’s a beautiful crowd. That’s beautiful. But remember Joe, so he’s standing there. He’s going to give healthcare to illegal immigrants, people that come into the country illegally, in other words, right. They come in illegally and under a plan, they have the manifesto. They want to give them a lawyer. That’s what we need is more lawyers now, okay. They want to give them a lawyer. They want to give them education. They want to give them healthcare, but they asked the question and I said, “Wow,” because I think they had like 26 people originally, but every one of them raised their hand including Sleepy Joe. And what happened is Joe’s like this, everybody other hand, and Joe, you could se he’s… For 47 years, he’s got the itch because he knows this isn’t going to work. He’s saying to himself, because you know there’s still something left. Not much, but he’s saying to himself there’s a natural instinct, right, a political instinct. And his shoulder went up and then his hand so I don’t know. I don’t think I’m even going to hold it to him. I’m not going to hold him. I got enough. How about the no fracking? We will not frack. Do you understand me? We will not. Then he gets a nomination, goes to Pennsylvania where they are reliant on energy and fracking and the jobs, probably 900 to a million jobs, right. Goes there the day after he says he’s not fracking. He says, “We will frack. We will frack.” And they don’t hold it to him. If I ever did that, it would be the end, but never going to be the end for us either, is it? You know that. Never going to be the end because we have something going that nobody has ever had going. We have a relationship with the people that nobody’s ever had. Not because I do think I’m a nice guy. A lot of people, they say suburbia, the suburban. I’ve saved the suburbs. Okay, I’ve saved the suburbs. Then I heard I’m not doing well with suburban women, okay. I got rid of… No, it’s true. They say that. But of course they said that last election too. He will do terribly with women, terribly. And then when I did great with women, they said, “Man, he did well with women.” Same thing’s going to happen. You know what I find? Suburban women, period, they want security. They don’t want their home values going down. They don’t want a low-income housing project built in the middle of suburbia next to their house. And we have a rule that’s a disaster. It’s a regulation, and I said to Ben Carson, and some people, I say, “I want to terminate.” They looked at me. They go, “Well, we can amend it.” I said, “You don’t understand. I want to terminate it.” You all know about it. It’s a disaster where they change the zoning and they make it impossible and you end up with low-income housing all over the place. And remember this, 29 to 30% of the people living in suburbia are minorities. So this has nothing to do with discrimination. It has nothing to do with anything. What it has to do is with the American dream, the American dream. We’re not going to destroy the American dream for stupid people like Cory Booker. He was putting Corey Booker in charge. How about that one? That’s a beauty. Yeah. He did a great job as mayor of Newark, New Jersey. That worked out. How’s Newark doing? This election is a choice between Trump recovery at a level that nobody’s ever seen before and a Biden depression. If they get elected, they’re going to double and triple and quadruple your taxes. You will have a depression the likes of which this country has never seen before and that probably includes 1929, okay. And one thing we learned about the farmers, they don’t do well in depressions. Do we agree? They don’t do well. Nobody does well under depression. You will have problems like you’ve never had before. Joe Biden would terminate our recovery, delay the vaccine, prolonged the pandemic. And by the way for those states, open up your states. Open them up. Watch on November 4th. November 4th, all these Democrat governors that have locked downs, right. I always said, I said right at the beginning, I think it was me that came out first. They’ll try and say, “20 years ago somebody said the same thing,” but I said, “The cure cannot be worse than the problem itself.” And if you look at what’s happening with these lockdown to children, get the children back to school. I’ll give you an example. The children, 99.9%. Barron Trump, you know he had the Corona 19, the China virus. It’s got 21 different names. I could go over it, but to me Corona means Italy. China is China, and it came from China so he had the China virus, right. And he had it for such a short period of time. I don’t even think he knew he had it because they’re young and their immune systems are strong and they fight it off 99.9% and Barron is beautiful and he’s free. Thank my wife, our First Lady who loves Iowa by the way. Our first lady, she put out that Barron has tested positive. And I said, “Wow.” And we talked about it. I said, “You put it out.” It’s personal stuff, but we really have it. I said, “Yeah, let’s put it out.” Barron’s tested positive. Within like two seconds, it was Barron is just fine now. He’s tested negative, right. Because it happens. People have it and it goes. Get the kids back to school. We got to get the kids back to school. Get them back to school. All right. Get them back. Get them back. And when I had it, you might’ve read, maybe most of you don’t know this, but I had it too. I didn’t love it, but it’s a little tough and you have a temperature and you don’t feel good. And then the scarier part is where’s it going? It’s fine. You’re at a 101 or a 102 and then you say that, “I don’t love this.” You haven’t had a temperature in years and then all of a sudden you have it, but you see what happens to people. And I went to the hospital and it’s an incredible hospital, Walter Reed. I’ve seen what they’ve done because I’ve been there many times for our great warriors that come back so badly wounded. And these doctors are incredible. And one thing when you’re president, I’m laying in this bed, not feeling my best. And I’m surrounded by 12 doctors, one’s the head of Johns Hopkins, one’s the head of Walter Reed, one’s the head… These incredible doctors. And I looked at the alternatives, all things we developed in the last seven months, and one of them is Regeneron. And I said, “I’ll take that one because it is very early into testing, but it had great numbers.” And I’m telling you, they gave me this and they call it a therapeutic. To me, it’s a cure because I felt like Superman the following morning. I felt like… In fact, I made a speech about a day later, two days later. Somebody said he looks better now than he did two weeks ago. What the hell is going on? So this is what’s happening. We’re making tremendous progress. The vaccines are coming out very soon. A lot of great things are happening on that front, but a lot of great things are happening for our country. I’m working to make the antibody treatment that I received to… I want to give it to all of the people that qualify for it, people in hospitals, people just before they go to hospitals. It will clean out our hospitals. Eli Lilly makes a very similar drug and we’re going to do it free. We’re going to do it free. It’s not their fault. We’re going to do it free. So we’re in that process of getting an emergency, it’s called emergency use authorization. And we’re going to Regeneron and the Eli Lilly, a comparable drug, we’re going to give it to everybody. And I hope they have the kind of luck that I have, but maybe I would have been perfect anyway. I like to say, “I didn’t need it. I would have been perfect anyway because I’m so strong.” I said sarcastically, I said, “Well, I’m in no danger because I’m in perfect physical shape and I’m very young.” And CNN goes and reports President Trump lied to the American public. They said, “Can you believe this?” I was telling last night we had an incredible rally in Pennsylvania. Oh, they’re doing at CNN. I thought they were doing it to me, I said, “We don’t have too many of them anymore.” Do you ever notice? At the beginning when we started, we would always have the phony people that stand up and raise their voice, then go home to mom and get balled up. I don’t know. I shouldn’t be talking about this because all of a sudden we’ll have one, but we don’t have that anymore. I learned about the cameras because the cameras never like showing it. Look where that crowd goes to. Look where that crowd goes to, all the way back to the buildings. And I’m always telling I never thought the cameras could move. And then I just noticed whenever we had a troublemaker in the audience, they’d spin around. They’d be in a pretzel, right? They can do anything these guys. I thought they were rigid, like a rigid piece of steel. They don’t turn, but if we had in the back room behind the pillar somebody, that camera would be turned around like a snake 15 different angles. But that sounds good. That’s a brand new F35 fighter jet. You can’t see it. They say it’s the greatest plane in the world. And by the way, speaking of that, our military, when I came in the world’s most overrated general told me, “Sir, we have no ammunition because we may have had a conflict very early in.” And I said, “No president should ever hear that.”, And we have rebuilt our military $ 2.5 trillion all made in the USA with equipment like that, the likes of which no country has ever seen before. We are the envy of Russia and China and any other country. We have equipment that nobody has. Our missiles, our rockets, our nuclear has been totally upgraded and pray to God we never have to use it because I see what happens. Pray to God, but if we didn’t have that, we could be in very big trouble. It’s a very tough situation. But you look at the new tanks that we’ve ordered from Ohio, by the way. We kept the Lima, the Lima Plant. I said, “Keep it open.” They were going to close it. I said, “Keep it open.” Before I became president, I said, “Keep it open,” because I visited. I said, “You could never build a plant like this. You could never get the people to make the tanks and we’re going to be ordering tanks.” we’ve totally rebuilt our military. We have the greatest missiles, rockets, tags, fighters, bombers, tankers, ships in the world, all made in the USA. You can be proud of your country. Look at this young handsome, this young, handsome farmer. You’re going to be a farmer someday? You’re going to be a farmer? Huh? He goes, “Hell yeah.” I’d like to be a farmer too sometimes I’ll tell you. We’re joined tonight by some incredible friends and great people. Your governor, who’s done an incredible job, Kim Reynolds and Kevin, her husband. Where is Kevin? Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Really great job, Kim. How are we doing by the way, okay? We’re looking good. That’s good. Thank you for everything Kim. As well as Lieutenant Governor Adam Greg. Adam, thank you. Thank you very much Adam. Great job. Iowa Secretary of Agriculture, Mike Naig. Mike, where’s Mike? Thank you, Mike. Iowas Senate Majority Leader, Jack Whitver. Thank you. See the way they all stay together. They like each other. Speaker of the Iowa House, oh, you got to tell me this. This is good genes I think, right. There are genes involved here, right. Pat Grassley, right. Good genes. What’s the relationship Pat? Huh? That’s good stuff. You got good stock. I want to bet on that guy in the future. Thank you very much. Great job. I hear you’re doing a great job. We’re doing all right? Good. Thank you Pat. Ambassador Terry Branstad. Okay, do we have time for one quick story about Branstad? Because his son, Eric is even better than him, but I’m not going to talk about it. And here’s the guy that doesn’t mind me saying.a lot of fathers, they get angry if you say that. Oh, I’m better than my son. Those are not great fathers. This guy’s proud. His son is great. But when I met Terry, it was long before I thought about this and I heard the Governor of Iowa was in New York and he wanted to see me. I said, “Oh, what the hell do I want to see the Governor of Iowa for?” I’m putting up buildings and I’m saying, “All right.” And I invited him before I ever thought about really doing this, early on at least. And he came up and a humble guy, great guy, handsome guy. That face, right. And he sat down and I figured I’d give him five minutes. Kim, no longer than that five. And I ended up spending an hour and a half. I said, “That is the smartest governor.” And then I learned, and as you know, he was the governor for 24 years. That’s an all time record in the United States, right. 24 years. And he told me a story in the first meeting. That was before I think that I was even thinking about doing this. And again, it’s only because Obama and Biden were so bad. I said, “Let me do it.” I wish I didn’t have to, but I’m having a lot of fun because we’re making such progress. But he told me a story. He said, “Many years ago I met a man in China because he was selling corn.” Can you believe it, right, corn crops. And he was selling corn. And he said to his wife, this is 35, 40 years ago. He said, “I met a man in China and I went home to my wife and I said, ‘I just met the next president of China many years forward, but I just met a future president of China.’ And I said, ‘Who was that?’ It was President Xi, who’s now the President of China.” And I said, “You got to be kidding.” He said, “Nope. I could tell right from the beginning he was different.” And I’m not happy with what’s going on, but he said, “I just met the next president.” And then I remembered that story and then I ran and he was so incredible to me and Iowa and he wanted us to win and his son was very much in charge of what we were doing and it worked out great and we won by a lot. And then we won the whole thing. And I said “We have to pick somebody really smart for China.” And I said, “The Governor of Iowa came to me and told me that story and I told him. I said, ‘How would you like to be ambassador to China?’ And he said, ‘Sir, I’ve been doing this for 24 years. It would be an honor.’ And I have to tell you this, he represented us great with China.” He represented us great. I never told that story. I never told that story, but about a month ago, he called and he said, “Sir, I want to come home now. I want to make sure you get reelected. I want to come home.” And he’s out there. I know he’s out there working, but we love him. He’s a special guy. We’ve got a couple of real beauties with Grassley and with this guy. I’ll tell you, what a couple of great people. Thank you very much for everything. Great job you did as ambassador. The only question I have is do we call you Mr. Ambassador or Mr. Governor? What do you like? He said, “Either one’s okay.” That’s him. Anyway, thank you very much. Great job. I want to introduce another one who’s one of the best, maybe the best in the whole country. He’s the chairman of the Iowa GOP, Jeff Kaufmann. You look good Jeff. You lost weight Jeff. You lost weight. I’m proud of you, Jeff. You do a great job. How are we doing? He said, “Iowa is ours.” Always be careful. He said, “Iowa is yours.” I say, “Never say that.” The last one, Beto, remember when he said that he was running for president. He was doing okay. And he was on the cover of a third grade magazine called Vanity Fair and he made the statement, “I was born to do this.” I said, “That’s the end of his political career.” He was born to do it. That didn’t work out. I hear we’re doing great. Thank you very much, Jeff. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Congressional candidate, a star, a guy who’s going to be fantastic, David Young. David, thank you. You got a lot of good candidates. We’re also joined by a very special guest, one of the greatest wrestlers in American history. You know that, right? He’s an unbelievable guy. I’ve known about him for a long time. Do we all love Jim Jordan, our Congressman, right? Jim Jordan. Jim Jordan is a great wrestler, a great NCAA champion. I know a lot of people don’t know that, but Jim, and Jim’s from Ohio, but he says the greatest of them all is a guy named Dan Gable. You ever hear of Dan Gable? And listen to this. I mean, I have to tell you, is Dan here? I hope he’s here. Come here Dave. Come on. Come on. Look at this. You mean I can’t take this guy in a fight? Can you believe it? Wow. Wow. . Hey Dan, I’m immune and I can’t give it to you so that’s good. We love you so. But I met Dan a few years ago and I looked at him and I said, “How come he’s 181-1. Think of it. He won 181. People don’t know that’s crazy. 181-1. I’m going to ask you later on who is the one? I want to find out who, but he did something else. He won the Olympics 1972. And to do that, he had to wrestle against the six greatest wrestlers in that weight class in the world. And he did something never done before. He didn’t yield one point throughout the whole thing and he ended up beating in the Olympic finals for the gold medal, he beat the great Russian wrestler. Didn’t get a point. He went through the whole thing. Nobody got a point and I’m looking at him and I’m saying to myself, “I’m telling you, I could take him, but I better not try.” But Dan has been inducted into the USA Wrestling Hall of Fame, the US Olympic Hall of Fame, the National Wrestling Hall of Fame, and the United World Wrestling Hall of Fame, and he’s become University of Iowa’s all time most winning coach. In fact, Jim Jordan said, He was as great a coach as he was a wrestler.” He won many. How many championships did you win as a coach Dan? 15. And I come from a town where you have the Jets, they never win. You have the Mets, they never win. We won 15. That’s called talent. It’s called extraordinary talent actually. And what I did is I thought about it. I thought about it long and hard. We’re very selective. So the Congressional Medal of Honor and the Presidential Medal of Freedom are the two greatest awards you can get in our country. And I’m proud to announce that I will be awarding very shortly at the White House in the Oval Office, Coach Gable the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Say something Joe. Great honor. Well, he’s the pride of Iowa and he’s great. You always try and figure out what makes a champion because you look at him. Nice guy, good looking guy, all that stuff, but why is he 181-1? Why is he a gold medalist that’s done something that nobody ever did? Didn’t allow one point of any of these wrestlers and they’re all the best of the world, the toughest, and it’s just something different and you’ll probably never figure it out. It is with great champions. You see it and you see it all the time with great champions, but there are very few. Jack Nicklaus you see it. Tiger got the same award. When Tiger won the Masters a few months ago, I said, “You know what, that’s an incredible thing he did.” And we gave him the Presidential Medal of Freedom and he said it’s one of the greatest honors. He actually said it’s his greatest honor. I said, “Tiger, you deserve it.” He went through a lot and he came back and… But you have great champions and they’re different and nobody knows why. That man is different and he’s a champion and it’s an honor to present you to the people that love you most, Iowa. Thank you. Thank you. Under my administration, we built the greatest economy in the history of the world, and now we’re doing it again. We’ve got a V-shape, we’re going to see some very big numbers and you’re seeing it. In my first three years, family income increased by $6,000. That’s more than five times the gains in all eight years under the last administration. African-American income grew nine times more than it did under Biden and Obama. We lifted 6.6 million Americans out of poverty. So proud of that. African-American unemployment, Hispanic American unemployment, and Asian American unemployment all reached the lowest levels in history. At the end of the last administration, the Congressional Budget Office projected fewer than 2 million jobs would be created over the next three years and we crushed that prediction and created almost 8 million jobs. Nobody can believe it and we’re doing it… Nobody can believe it. We’re doing it again. My policies have benefited those who needed it the most. The bottom 50% of households saw an astonishing 40% increase in net worth after our tax cuts, wages grew fastest for the nicest, I mean it makes me feel so good, blue collar workers. They were the ones that had the biggest benefit from what we did. Since the China virus, we have created a record 11.4 million jobs. That’s a record. We’ve never created jobs at a level at which we’re creating them now. We’ve already cut the unemployment rate in half, we’re down to 7.8%. Sounds high, but a lot of people said we’re going to be a 42%. We’re down to 7.8 and going down rapidly. Under Biden, it took 30 months to recover more than half of the jobs lost, 30 months. We did it in five months. Jobs have been recovering. Think of this. Jobs have been recovering 23 times faster than the Obama-Biden recovery. 23 times faster. Not 23%, 23 times faster. I’ve spent the last four years reversing the damage Joe Biden inflicted over the last 47 years. He supported NAFTA, a disaster. Now you have USMCA, it’s the best. It’s now kicked in. He supported TPP. Would have destroyed your farms, would have destroyed everything, and our auto industry would have been gone, and he supported China’s entry into the World Trade Organization, a catastrophe for our nation. China tries to get away with the fact that they are a developing nation. Not anymore. If Biden wins, China wins. That’s what’s going to happen. If Biden wins, China will own our country. They’ll own it. And if we win, Iowa wins, and America wins, and we’re going to win for a long time. For decades, our politicians spent trillions of dollars rebuilding foreign nations, fighting foreign wars, and defending foreign borders. But now we are finally protecting our nation, rebuilding our cities, and we are bringing our jobs, our factories, and our troops back home to the USA where they belong. As I mentioned, one of the things that was very important to me was to eliminate the very unfair estate tax or death tax on small businesses and farms. Now, if you love your child and you’re a farmer and you think he’s doing a great job or she’s doing a great job, and she wants to keep the farm or he wants to keep the farm, there is no more estate tax where they have to go out and borrow a fortune to pay the tax. Is there anybody here who has a child to which they do not want to leave the farm because they don’t like their child? Raise your hand, please. Does anybody have the courage? There’s one person over there. He says he’s only kidding. No, but it’s a big thing. I mean, look, it’s a big thing. A lot of farms were put out of business. The parents, they pass away, they leave the farm to the son, the daughter, to the family, and the family has to go out and borrow a fortune and then they have a little bad season, a couple of bad seasons, and they end up losing everything. We don’t have that anymore. We cut the estate tax, it’s out, gone. These are things a lot of people don’t even know. We’ve got that. Along with the tax cuts, we got that. Biden wants to repeal our tax cuts and massively raised taxes on your family farms. And what we did was hit the, you know this, you know exactly, we hit it so quickly. We hit so hard. We hit so strong on this whole tax situation because the farmers were being treated unfairly. So unfairly with respect to taxes. I quickly issued a major disaster declaration and I will be with you every step of the way. I think Kim will say this, your governor, when you had floods all over the place, you were like a large scale swimming pool. I hate to say it, Iowa. I looked at the pictures that your governor sent. I said, “Kim, I never knew that this was ocean front property.” And we took care of you, right? We gave you everything you needed and we got rid of all of, we’ve rebuilt the dams and the dikes. Right? We rebuilt it and we rebuilt it fast. My opponent is foot forward, a radical plan to eliminate US borders by implementing catch and release, imposing deadly sanctuary cities and suspending all removals of illegal alien. So if you have somebody that’s a murderer or a rapist, we can’t do it. They agreed with Bernie Sanders, crazy Bernie. There’s nobody that knows how to lose like Bernie. Four years ago, he lost, he went home happy. He lost again because Pocahontas refused to get out of the race. Otherwise, I would have been running against Bernie. I don’t know which is better. There would have been a lot more enthusiasm for Bernie, smaller base, more enthusiasm, Bernie got, I’ll tell you. We’re going to get a lot of the Bernie voters because they don’t like Joe. And they love our policy on dealing with other nations because they love our policy on trade because they understand. They happen to understand that, but they also know we can do something about it. Bernie would have never been able to do that. The United States would be completely overrun in a matter of days. Under my leadership, we achieved the most secure border in US history and we are finishing the wall. It’s now over 400 miles long. It’s already built. And as I said, Mexico is paying for the wall. We did more, one of these fake reporters said it, we did more, one of the only politicians that’s ever run, forget about politician, but one of the only politicians ever run that actually has done more than he or she has promised. As an example, I campaigned a lot in Iowa. I never mentioned the word space force, but when I got into office, I realized I looked at Russia, I looked at Kim Jong-un, I looked at China. I said, “We need a space force,” and we got space force. I never talked about it on the campaign trail. We also passed VA choice for our great veterans and VA accountability, things that they said were impossible to get done. So now, instead of waiting online for weeks and weeks, if they have to wait, they go out to a doctor, we pay the bill and it’s been a great thing. 91% approval rating in the VA. They’re doing a great job over there. Think of it, I shouldn’t be telling you this because they’ll find a vet someplace who’s unhappy. But think of it, all our lives we used to see on the evening news horror shows with the vets and the vets and the vets, and it’s terrible what they’re doing. You don’t see any stories about the VA. You don’t see any stories. We have done 91% approval rating by the vets for the VA, the job we’re doing. And we defeated 100%. We’re bringing our soldiers home, but we defeated 100% of the ISIS caliphate in Syria and Iraq. And when I took over, it was a mess. And we killed the leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi. They were looking for him for years and years. And we then took out the world’s number one terrorist and the mass murderer of American troops and many other troops and many other people, Qasem Soleimani is dead. Dead. One of the biggest things to happen in the Middle East in 50 years. I withdrew from the last administration’s disastrous Iran nuclear catastrophe. $150 billion, $1.8 billion in cash for nothing. That deal’s practically expiring now anyway, if we didn’t terminate it. I kept my promise, recognized the true capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. And you know that presidents have been talking about that for decades. Every president said they were going to do that, then they never had the guts to do it. I also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, and that’s been 52 years they’ve been talking about that. I got it done in about two hours. And instead of endless war, we’re forging peace in the Middle East. So I get nominated for three Nobel Peace Prizes, different subjects. And I told the story the other night, I was in Florida or Pennsylvania, I told our First Lady, “Darling, we’re going to have the greatest publicity I’ve ever had tonight. I got nominated for the Nobel Prize. Do you know what that is, darling.” Let’s go home. So I leave for the first time in a long time, early. I get home, I turn on the television. They talked about your floods in Iowa. They talked about how’s Iowa doing with the crops. How’s this happening? How are they doing in Florida? Three, four stores, one after another, where’s my Nobel Peace Prize, they don’t talk about it. I said, “Darling, this news is a little tough. It’s a little tough to crack.” When Obama got his Nobel Prize, it was so early he didn’t even do anything. He still doesn’t know what he got at for. They said, “Why did you get it?” He said, “I have no idea.” And it was the biggest story, it was all over the place. With me, I got three and they got three dominations, nobody talks about it. So at least I figured I might as well mentioned it, right? Kim, I should mention it, right? Kevin. Right, Kevin? Kevin, stand up please, Kevin. There’s the guy. I went on a hunting trip. My son, Don, he loves hunting. And he went Kevin, Don and about 300 of the governors, your previous Terri, your previous governor’s friends. And they all went hunting and it was like 25 degrees below zero. The only two guys that stood out there the whole time were Kevin and Don Trump Jr. And they came back. Everyone else was back at about 15 minutes, Terry, right? There were all back and they wanted to go back into the lodge, the hell with this. And after a weekend, my son comes back and Kevin comes back and you two guys didn’t even know what they were talking about. You didn’t know what the problem was. Right? People don’t know that about Don and they don’t know that, but Kevin is fantastic. Thank you Kevin, for being here. Appreciate it. He’s a real guy. So I’m ending the old wars and Biden will lead us into new wars. And we did more in 47 months than Biden did in 47 years, and that’s a fact. And if you look at the Democrats, they’re pushing the most far left agenda ever put forward by a presidential nominee. Their plan would destroy your social security, destroy protections for pre-existing conditions. Biden vowed to terminate our travel bans on jihadist regions. I got the travel ban. Everyone said, “Oh, that’s not nice.” I said, “Really?” It’s not nice to come up and blow up cities either is it? We won on the United States Supreme Court and he wants to end it. And surge refugee admissions by 700%, meaning 700% opening the flood gates to radical Islamic terrorism. No thank you. No thank you, sleepy Joe. He’ll ban school choice and he’ll ban charter schools, very important places. Civil rights all starts with the education and we need school choice. In a second term, I will provide school choice to every parent in America. We’ve already started. We’ve already started. It’s an incredible thing because it’s great education for less money. It’s sort of a crazy thing. Less money, great education. And just to finish up, a vote for Republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs and a limitless future for all Americans. Over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world. And we will end our reliance on China once and for all. It’s already happened. We will hire more police, increase penalties for assaults or law enforcement and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech and the right to keep and bear arms, your Second Amendment. We will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens and we will keep America out of ridiculous, horrible, endless foreign wars. We will maintain America’s unrivaled military might. We have never, ever been even close to as strong as we are right now, greatest equipment ever in our history. And we will ensure peace through strength. If you remember, when I ran, they said, “Oh, he’s a very militant kind of a guy. We’ll be in a war the first week.” Well, where’s the war? Where’s the war? And I’m making other countries pay because NATO, they weren’t paying their bills. They were delinquent to use the New York real estate term. They weren’t paying their bills. I said, “You got to pay.” The secretary general of NATO is my single biggest fan. They’re paying $130 billion a year more now because I said, “Look, you got to pay. You got to pay.” They rip us on trade and there was supposed to protect them, the European Union. So NATO, so they’re paying 130 billion more going to $410 billion more each year. So that’s it. Where are the wars? He’s going to get us into a war. Where are the wars? They don’t want any part of us. Nobody wants any part of us in the world. They were tired of being ripped off as a country. We will end surprise medical billing. The surprise medical billing is a disaster. It’s ending as of January 1st. Require price transparency, all signed, all done, January 1st. Can you imagine if I lose and I’ve done all these things? They kick in on January 1st. You’re going to say “Boy, that Biden’s done a great job on price transparency.” And they’ll say, “What are you thinking? He has no idea what the hell it is.” And further reduce the cost of prescription drugs. We went through a favorite nations clause so that we will pay the lowest drug prices in the world. Okay? We will strongly protect Medicare and social security and we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. America will land the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. And when I took over, NASA was basically closed. It was shredded, it was nothing. And now it’s the number one preeminent space center, anywhere in the world by far. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education through our schools. We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history and always respect our great American flag. We will live by the timeless words of our national motto, in God we trust, and it won’t change. For years, you had a president who apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the great people of Iowa. Get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get your workers and coworkers and get the hell out to vote because if I don’t get Iowa, I won’t believe that one. I may never have to come back here again if I don’t get Iowa. I’ll never be back. You understand that Kim? I will say this. There has never been a president has done more for farmers and ranchers. For the farm belt, for Iowa, there’s never been a president that’s even come close to what I’ve done. And I will say that and I’ll say it louder and clearer. I’ll say that loud and clear. From Cambridge to Council Bluffs, from Cedar Rapids to Rock Rapids, from Davenport to right here in Des Moines, we stand on the shoulders of Iowa patriots who gave their blood, sweat, and tears for this beloved nation. We inherit the legacy of American heroes. Just nobody has anything more than what you have so much. Look at yourselves and look where you’ve come. Look even in the world of politics, Iowa, it’s Iowa. And by the way, as long as I’m here, Iowa, and I made this pledge to you four years ago, Iowa will always come first in the rotation. You know what that means, right? There’s a lot of pressure. Let’s put them back. I said, “No, you’re not putting them back.” You know why? Because that’s called the opposite of cancel culture. That’s called a great American tradition. Iowa will always be number one. Okay? You can forget it. We inherit the legacy of American heroes who crossed the oceans, blaze the trails, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, laid down the railroads, dug out the Panama Canal, raised up the skyscrapers, won two World Wars, defeated fascism and communism, and landed our brave American astronauts on the face of the moon. So much you’ve done. We made America into the single greatest nation in the history of the world and the best is yet to come. Proud citizens like you helped build this country. And together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. Because we are one movement, we are one people in one family. We are one glorious nation under God. And together with the incredible people of Iowa, we have made America wealthy again. We have made America strong again. We have made America proud again. We will make America safe again and we will make America great again. Thank you Iowa. Thank you. Thank you very much. I’m feeling great, I don’t know about you. How is everyone feeling? It’s great to be back in my home state, Florida, to make my official return to the campaign trail. My goal is to fight for you and fight for your family. That was very well stated, I have to say. Good job. Thank you, thank you. Nothing whatsoever, I’m great, I feel good. I was in North Carolina today and did a big rally with tremendous turnout, and I just feel really good. Florida, Pennsylvania, were- They said, “Let’s go to the hospital.” I said, “That’s okay. I’m going to respond to what you say.” And we went over to Walter Reed, where you have tremendous professionals. They gave me Regeneron and Remdeceiver both. And all I know is I felt good the following day, I felt really good. No, but they said the lungs are a little bit different, a little bit perhaps infected, and- I don’t know. I mean, I didn’t do too much asking. I really felt good. I didn’t have much of a problem with the lungs. I did have a little bit of a temperature. Obviously, I felt there was something missing, and then I tested, I tested positive. Yeah, and there shouldn’t be. Well, I test quite a bit, and I can tell you that before the debate, which I thought it was a very good debate, and I felt fantastically, I had no problems before. I don’t know, I don’t even remember. I test all the time. But I can tell you this, after the debate, I guess a day or so, I think it was Thursday evening, maybe even late Thursday evening, I tested positive. That’s when I first found out about it. Yeah. I had no problem. Again, the doctors do it. I don’t ask them. I test all the time. And they- If you ask as the doctor, they’ll give you a perfect answer. But they take a test and I leave and I go about my business. I probably did, and I took a test the day before and the day before, and I was always in great shape, and I was in great shape for the debate. And it was only after the debate, a period of time after the debate that I said, “That’s interesting.” And they took a test and it tested positive. No. No, but I take a lot of tests. Possibly I did, possibly I didn’t. But the doctor has very accurate information and it’s not only that doctor, it’s many doctors. The one thing, if you’re President, you have a lot of doctors you’re surrounded by. But I was in great shape for the debate. And sometime after the debate, I tested positive, then that’s when they decided to, let’s go. Well, they do a lot of testing in the White House, they test everybody including me, but they test everybody. And something happened. But as far as the mask is concerned, I’m good with masks. I’m okay with masks. I tell people, wear a mask. But just the other day, they came out with a statement that 85% of the people that wear masks catch it. So this is a very- That’s what I heard, and that’s what I saw. And regardless, but everybody’s tested and they’re tested often. And I also knew that, hey, I’m President. I have to see people. I can’t be in a basement. I can’t be in a room. I can’t be… I have to be out. I can, but people with masks are catching it all the time. I mean, if you look at the Governor of Virginia, he was known for a mask. If you look at Thom Tillis, a great guy, he always had a mask, and they caught it. Yeah. Yes, I know this. Well, I mean, he has to say that. I think it’s great, he’s a friend of mine. He’s a good guy. And wrong or not wrong, you have to understand, as President, I can’t be locked in a room someplace for the next year and just stay and do nothing. And every time I go into a crowd, I was with the parents of our fallen heroes. These people are the most incredible people. And they came up to me and they would hug me, and they would touch me, and I’m not to not let them do it, to be honest with you. There was, exactly right. We had a gold star event with the most incredible people you’ve ever seen. And I could have chosen not to talk to them, or to keep everybody away. And you know what? I don’t think that’s probably where it was caught, but maybe it was. No, I don’t know where it came from, and you don’t know where it came from, and the doctors don’t know where it came from. But as the President, I have to be out there. I also know- I know this. I mean, let’s see, Kamala. She’s got people now, people have it, and I’m not blaming her. I’m not saying, “Oh, she did a terrible thing.” As President, I have to be out there. I can’t be in a basement. I can’t be locked in a very beautiful room someplace in the White House. And I want to see the gold star families, and I want to see everybody. And I also say to people all the time, it’s risky doing it. It is risky doing it. But many people are catching it. Many people are getting this disease that was sent to us by China, and it shouldn’t have been allowed to happen. But many people are getting this. And I mean, nobody’s being blamed. Everybody is working hard to get this thing out of our country, get it out of the world. Look at what’s going on in Europe, massive spikes. They’ve done a very good job, but now you take a look today at the UK, you take a look at Spain and France and Italy. There’s tremendous spikes. Well, I have thing right here that will tell you exactly the opposite. The UK is up 2500%, because I knew you’d be doing this. I know you very well. The UK is up 2500%. The EU is up 722%. And the United States is down 21%. Excess mortality. Excess mortality, we’re a winner on the excess mortality. And what we’ve done has been amazing. And we have done an amazing job. And it’s rounding the corner and we have the vaccines coming, and we have the therapies coming. And I’ll tell you what, one thing. When I got it, I had a choice. Do nothing, or use some of the things that we’re looking at, like in this case, Regeneron. and Eli Lilly makes something that’s supposed to be incredible. And I think that maybe I wouldn’t be doing this discussion with you right now. We have therapies now and cures, maybe you can use the word cure, but we have therapies that are absolutely incredible, Savannah. I believe we’re rounding the corner, yes. Right, right. That’s right. Yeah. The cure can not be worse than the problem itself. We did the right thing. We were expected to lose 2,200,000 people, and maybe more than that. We’re at 210,000 people. One person is too much, it should have never happened because of China. It happened because of China. And you have to get that and understand that. But it shouldn’t have happened. But we were expected to lose, if you look at the original charts from original doctors who are respected by everybody, 2,200,00 people. We saved 2 million people. I don’t know, let me tell you what is happening. I left North Carolina, which I love. I left Pennsylvania. We won a big case in Michigan because that governor has a lockdown where nobody but her husband can do anything. He can go boating and do whatever he wants, but nobody else can. The fact is we’re winning all these cases because it’s unconstitutional what they’re doing. And I think they’re doing it for political reasons. But the fact is the cure, you can’t let this continue to go on with the lockdowns. And I believe that on November 4th, you’re going to have a lot of these governors. Look at what’s happening to New York. New York is a mess. They lost almost 40,000 people. They have a lockdown like you’ve never seen. Now they’re open, it’s like a ghost town. And Savannah, it’s very important. People are leaving New York by the thousands, and you’re going to have a hard time ever building it up again. So that cure, that so called cure that you talk about, it can’t be worse than the problem. The problem is a bad problem. … than the problem. The problem is a bad problem. Okay, fine. Oh, you always do this. No, you always do this. You’ve done this to me, and everybody- I denounce white supremacy. Okay? I’ve denounced white supremacy, for years, but you always do it. You always start off with the question. You didn’t ask Joe Biden, whether or not he denounces Antifa. I watched him on the same basic show with Lester Holt, and he was asking questions like Biden was a child. So, are you ready? Are you… Wait. Are you listening? I denounce white supremacy. What’s your next question? Hesitant? Here we go again. Every time… In fact, my people came, “I’m sure they’ll ask you the white supremacy question.” I denounce white supremacy. And frankly, you want to know something? I denounce Antifa, and I denounce these people on the left that are burning down our cities, that are run by Democrats who don’t know what they’re doing- So, I know - Yeah. I know nothing about QAnon. I know very little. You told me, but what you tell me, doesn’t necessarily make it fact. I hate to say that. I know nothing about it. I do know they are very much against pedophilia. They fight it very hard. But I know nothing about it. If you’d like me to- … study the subject. I’ll tell you what I do know about. I know about Antifa, and I know about the radical left, and I know how violent they are and how vicious they are. And I know how they are burning down cities run by Democrats, not run by Republicans. He may be right. Can I be honest? He may be right. I just don’t know about QAnon. I don’t know. No, I don’t know. I don’t know. You tell me all about it. Let’s waste the whole show. You start off with white supremacy. I denounce it. You start off with something else. Let’s go. Keep asking me these questions. But let me just- … let me just tell you. What I do hear about it, is they are very strongly against pedophilia. And I agree with that. I mean, I do agree with that- … and I agree with it very strongly. I have no idea. I know nothing about them. No, I don’t know that. And neither do you, know that. Why aren’t you asking me about Antifa? Why aren’t you asking me about the radical left? Why aren’t you asking Joe Biden questions about, why doesn’t he condemn Antifa? Why does he say it doesn’t exist? Antifa, no, excuse me. That’s so cute. Antifa exists. They’re vicious, they’re violent. They kill people, and they’re burning down our cities. And they happen to be radical left. I know nothing about it, can I - That was a retweet. That was an opinion of somebody- …. and that was a retweet. I’ll put it out there. People can decide for themselves. I don’t take a position. No, no. No, no. That was a retweet. And I do a lot of retweets. And frankly, because the media is so fake, and so corrupt, if I didn’t have social media… I don’t call it Twitter, I call it social media. I wouldn’t be able to get the word out. And the word is- … and you know what the word is? The word is very simple. We’re building our country, stronger and better than it’s ever been before. And that’s what’s happening. And everybody knows it. You know what else the word is? We’re winning in a lot of states. We’re winning in a lot of States. You’re going to see that. Sure, they can. And do you know what? Win or lose, that’s the way I want it to be. But when I see thousands of ballots, right? Unsolicited ballots, being given out by the millions, and thousands of them are dumped in dumpsters. And when you see ballots with the name Trump, military ballots, from our great military. And they’re dumped in garbage cans- No, no, it’s happening every day. Oh, really? Well, then he’s not doing a very good job. All you have to do is pick up the papers every day. 50,000 in Ohio, the great state of Ohio. 50,000 in another location, I think North Carolina. 500,000 applications in Virginia. No, no, there’s a tremendous problem. But let me just tell you, they talk about the peaceful transfer, right? They spied on my campaign and they got caught. And they spied heavily, on my campaign. And they tried to take down a duly elected sitting president. And then, they talk about, “Will you accept a peaceful transfer?” And the answer is, yes, I will. But I want it to be an honest election. And so does everybody else. When I see thousands of ballots dumped in a garbage can, and they happen to have my name on it? I’m not happy about that. Could I ask you, how can you say that? How can you say that? You do read newspapers? You do watch the news? I know you read the news, but do you watch it? Because, every day, they’re talking about ballots that are corrupt, that are fraudulent. Sure. Sure, sure. But you can win a race… Take a look at me. You can win a race by 1%. I’m not, I don’t want that to happen. You know what? I don’t want that to happen. Savannah. I want it to be clean. And I want… I really feel we’re going to win, but I want this to be clean. But it’s sort of ironic that you, and them, talk about the peaceful transfer when I spent three and a half years fighting off these maniacs. And now, it turns out, everything’s there. That they were the ones that dealt with Russia, and it’s too bad. Peaceful transfer, I absolutely want that. But ideally, I don’t want to transfer, because I want to win. Sure. How are you? Thank you very much, it’s beautiful. As what? Well, I did put it in very early, as you know, Joe Biden was two months behind me, and he called me xenophobic and racist and everything else, because I put it in. And it turned out that I was 100% right. I also put it on Europe, very early, because I saw there was a lot of infection in Europe. And it’s sort of an amazing question. And I appreciate the question, and respect the question, but the news doesn’t get out the right answer. Because I put on a travel ban far earlier than Dr. Fauci thought it was necessary. Who I like. Far earlier than the scientists… I was actually the only one that wanted to put it on. And I did it, actually against the advice of a lot of people, including Nancy Pelosi who had no clue what she was doing. And, Biden. When I put on the travel ban… You know, I put it on in January. The end of January. When I put on the travel ban Joe Biden, and others, said, “This is ridiculous. You don’t do that.” Well, Dr. Fauci said, I saved thousands and thousands of lives. I was early, I was extremely early, when I put on the travel ban. I read that, but no, he didn’t. I read it… I read it, someplace. Maybe Woodward said it, or something. But no, he did not say that. But, I knew it was a big threat. At the same time, I don’t want to panic this country. I don’t want to go out and say, “Everybody’s going to die. Everybody’s going to-” Okay? No, there’s not a middle ground. No, no. No. There’s not a middle ground. You have to be safe. You have to be vigilant, and you have to be smart. Okay. Good. We’ll talk you out of it. Miami. Right. Right. Right. So, it’s happening. We just set a record, 11.4 million jobs. We are going to have a phenomenal third quarter, which will be announced on November 1st, just prior to the big November 3rd day, where I think you’re going to see a red wave. But we’re going to have a tremendous announcement. I believe. I mean, we’re going to find out, but GDP is going through the roof. Jobs, real estate, houses. So many things are happening. So, people were saying, we’re going to have a 42% unemployment. Look, this was a thing that came into our country and it happened a hundred, more than a hundred years ago, and it happened now. They were talking about a 42% unemployment rate. It came out, it just came out- … at 7.8% unemployment, and people can’t even believe it. Our economy is going to be… Next year, if we don’t have somebody that raises taxes and quadruples taxes, which they want to do, and it kills everything. Our economy is going to be phenomenal, next year. We’re going to have a phenomenal… And, I’ll tell you, Savannah. We had the greatest economy in the history of our country last year, including the state of Florida, where we are now. In Pennsylvania, in North Carolina, in Ohio, every place. We had the greatest economy we ever had. We had to close it down, we saved two million lives. We’re opening it up. We have a V-shape and it’s coming back. It’s coming back very fast. One other thing, we really helped the hospitals. We’ve sent billions and billions of dollars to the hospitals. In addition, hundreds of millions of masks and gowns. And we went into the ventilator business, because this country was not equipped with ventilators. And I’m not blaming anybody for it. But we’re now making thousands of ventilators a month, and we have all we can use. We’re sending them all over the world, because the world needs them. So, they’ve worked very hard and really very, very effectively. Thank you. Great question. No, because I was okay with the masks. I was good with it, but I’ve heard many different stories on masks. I had, being president, you have people, they bring meals, they bring this, they… And I had an instance recently, where a very wonderful person is bringing me a meal, and he’s playing with his mask. And he’s touching his mask, all over the place. And then he’s bringing a plate in, and I’m saying, “Well, I don’t know if that’s so good.” I mean, the good news, I didn’t eat it. Okay? I decided not to eat it. This was a month ago. But I… Look, look, you have, on the masks, you have two stories. You have a story where they want, a story where they don’t want. I am all for it. Some. No. No, the . And then, you have other people that disagree. Scott Atkins, if you look at Scott, Dr. Scott. He’s from, great guy, Stanford. He will tell you that, he disagrees with you. Oh, I don’t know. Look, he’s an expert. He’s one of the great experts of the world. I’m all for it. By the way- I never said, “Don’t wear them.” Savannah, University of Washington. And then, you have other places, say different things. You have a lot of… Hey. Dr. Fauci said, “Don’t wear a mask,” right? Oh, I don’t know. Then he changed his mind. But then, you have a report coming out two days ago, that 85% of the people wearing masks catch it. Savannah. We’re on the same side. I say, wear the mask. I’m fine with it. I have no problem. We’re on the same side. Thank you. (silence). Thank you. Thank you very much. Good. So we got rid of the individual mandate on Obamacare, which was the worst part of Obamacare, and now you could actually say it’s not Obamacare because that’s how big it was, where you had to pay a fortune for the privilege of not having to pay for bad health insurance, so we got rid of that. That was a big, big thing. And by doing that, and we will always have… By the way, we’re always protecting people with pre-existing conditions, and I can’t say that more strongly, but we’ve been able to bring healthcare costs way down. Now, I took over Obamacare, got rid of the individual mandate, made it good, managed it much better. Remember, they had the $5 billion website disaster, and all of the problems they had. The problem with Obamacare, it’s not good. We’d like to terminate it, and we want a much less expensive healthcare that’s a much better healthcare, and that’s where we’re aiming. And if we can do that, and we have a very good chance of doing it, but we’ve also brought down the price of Obamacare. The problem with Obamacare, it basically is never going to be great, and I want to give great healthcare. So important. And thank you very much. It is a big issue for me too. That’s right. That’s right. In order to replace it with a much better healthcare at a much lower price. And always, under all circumstances, we are going to protect the Republicans. And maybe I changed the party a lot over the last three years, but we will protect people with preexisting conditions. And Savannah, what I want to do, get rid of the terrible Obamacare. I’ve already done it to a large extent because as you know, the individual mandate is gone. That was the worst part. No, no. We have done- That’s right. I’m sorry, but if you look, we had both houses and what did we do? We got rid of the individual mandate. That went through the legislature. Look, look. We should be on the same side. I wanted very simple. I’m going to put it very simple. We would like to terminate it, and we would like to replace it with something that’s much less expensive and much better. We will always protect people with preexisting conditions. And here’s the thing- If we don’t succeed, we are running the remnants of whatever’s left because we took it apart. We are running the remnants of whatever’s left much better than the previous administration, which ran it very badly, but we’d like to have new healthcare much better and much less expensive. Well, we’ve actually passed three packages, and we’re on our fourth, and I agree with him 100%. He should vote for me. The problem you have is Nancy Pelosi. She couldn’t care less about the worker. She couldn’t care less about our people. And we should have a stimulus, and I want a stimulus. The Republicans will approve a stimulus. The problem is she doesn’t want to do it because she thinks it’s bad for her election. The fact is, she’s wrong because people know she’s in our way, she’s not approving it, she doesn’t appreciate our people, and she doesn’t appreciate, at all, our workers. Nancy Pelosi, we are ready to sign and pass stimulus, but she’s got to approve it. That’s right. That’s right. Did you ever hear a word called negotiation when negotiating? Okay. I’m negotiating- You know what? And you know who I’m negotiating against? Nancy Pelosi, because she doesn’t want to give them money. We should have stimulus. This was not our people’s fault. This was China’s fault. And she’s penalizing our people. I’m ready to sign a big, beautiful stimulus. You saw the other day, I said, “Go big or go home.” Right? I want it to be big. I want it to be bold. I want the money to go to directly to the people. They’ll go. Yeah, they’ll go. They’ll go. They’re going be very active- I know, because I haven’t asked them to because I can’t get through Nancy Pelosi. If Nancy Pelosi and I, through my representatives or directly, I don’t care, if we agree to something, the Republicans will agree to it. How are you? Nice to see you. Thank you. It’s a great question. We’ve created more jobs than this country has ever created. We were up to 160 million jobs. We were never even close to that number. We were just hitting 160 million jobs, companies are pouring into our nation because of the tax rate, and if Biden comes in and raises taxes on everybody, including middle income taxes, which he wants to do, you will blow this thing, and you’ll end up with a depression, the likes of which you’ve never had. That’s what’s going to happen. We have something that’s really good. The reason we’re coming back so strong is because we built a very strong foundation. Companies are moving in. Car companies are moving into Michigan, into Ohio, into South Carolina, and North Carolina just today, so what’s happening is, they’re coming in because we reduced the taxes. Our taxes, our corporate taxes were the highest in the world, and now they’re among the lower taxes. They’re not the lowest, but they’re among the lowest. And what that means, is jobs, but also we’re doing a very big, and we’ve done a very big, middle income tax package. So if we get in, we’re going to do the middle income tax package, but it’s a great question. And if he comes along and raises rates, all those companies that are coming in, they will leave the U.S. so fast your head will spin. We can’t let that happen. Thank you. Okay, first of all, let me answer. What they did is illegal, number one. Also, the numbers are all wrong, with the numbers they released. And just so you understand, when you have a lot of real estate, I have real estate, you know a lot of it. Okay? Right down the road, Doral, big stuff, great stuff. When I decided to run, I’m very underlevered, fortunately, but I’m very underlevered. I have a very, very small percentage of debt compared. In fact, some of it, I did as favors to institutions that wanted to loan me money. $400 million compared to the assets that I have, all of these great properties all over the world, and frankly, The Bank of America building in San Francisco. I don’t love what’s happening to San Francisco. 1290 Avenue of the Americas, one of the biggest office buildings. What I’m saying is that, it’s a tiny percentage of my net worth. And you’ll see that soon because we’re doing things. We’ve given, I think it’s 108 or 112 pages of financial detail to elections, and we have to file as the president, as any politician, you have to file. Nobody ever looks at that. When they do, they see how incredible a company is, but more importantly, they see where this debt is. No, I don’t owe Russia money. I owe a very, very small… It’s called mortgages. People have a house, they put a mortgage. Not that I know of, but I will probably, because it’s so easy to solve, and if you’d like to do, I will let you know who I owe, whatever small amount of money. I want to say two things. Number one, it’s a very small amount of money. Number two, it’s very straight. It’s very, very straight, but it’s a tiny percentage of the worth. Did you ever hear the expression underlevered? I am extremely underlevered. As you know, I’m under audit. It turned out that I am under audit. But they actually… Excuse me. No, no. But you accused me of not being under audit previously. And so did other people at NBC. And I am under audit. So that one’s solved. That’s good. I am under audit. No person in their right mind would release, prior to working out the deal with the IRS. And I’ll go a step further. I’m treated very badly by the IRS. They treat me very, very badly. You have people in there from previous administrations that treat me very badly, but we’re under audit. It’s very routine, in many ways, but we’re under audit. They like to change the game, change the rules, do everything. You saw what they did with the tea party people. You saw what they did with the religious group. No, except common sense, and intelligence, and having lawyers that say… Because I would love to release them, and as soon as we come to a conclusion, I will release them, and very gladly, but if you go to elections, and if you take a look, you’ll see 112, I think it’s 112, it talks about the income, which is rather massive. It talks about all of the properties. They have them listed. You can never learn more, but you know what happened? People went there. All the reporters went. There was a feeding frenzy. This was originally, when I filed it. And I filed it every year. I update it every year. My son is here. They run the company. I don’t run the company. Yeah, because that’s a statutory number. It’s a statutory. I think it’s a filing number. You pay 750, it’s a filing or a filing fee. No, I don’t know. I can tell you this. If they have my tax returns, as you know, they have to go to jail. It’s illegal, but their numbers were wrong, but let me tell you what else. I don’t owe money to any of these sinister people. This has been going on for years now. Russia, Russia, Russia. It turned out to be a hoax, and it turned out to be that Hillary Clinton and the Democrats were dealing with Russia, not me. It’s a whole hoax. So I would not mind at all saying who it is, but it’s a very small… When you look at vast properties like I have, and they’re big, and they’re beautiful, and they’re well located. When you look at that, the amount of money, $400 million is a peanut. It’s extremely underlevered. And it’s levered with normal banks. Not a big deal. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Adam. So when I was elected, and when a president is elected, they’re elected for a period of four years. And Justice Ginsburg said it best. I think, talking about president Obama having to do with somebody else, that the president is put there for four years, not for three years. So during this fourth year, it happened to come up, unfortunately, because I had great respect for Justice Ginsburg. But a vacancy happened to come up, and we picked somebody that’s outstanding. She has been an absolute star, and I’m extremely proud of it. But again, plenty of time. There’s plenty of time. We’re going to do it before the election, but we also have much time after the election. But there’s no reason to wait, because it’s almost unanimous, it seems to me, certainly within the Republican party. And frankly, most of the Democrats within closed rooms, I guarantee you that. This is an outstanding person, and I’m using my fourth term. And if you look at it and if you put the shoe on the other foot, if they had this, they would do it 100%. So there’s been 29 times when this has happened. All 29 times a president has done exactly what I’ve done. So I have a lot of respect, by the way, for- I have a lot of respect for Judge Garland. I want to tell you that. But I’ll tell you, the whole ball game changed when I saw the way they treated Justice Kavanaugh. I have never seen any human being, and I’m not just talking about Supreme Court… I have never seen a human being treated so badly with false accusations and everything else. I have never seen anything like it. And you know what the truth is, Savannah? Like it or not, the ball game changed a lot. There has never been anybody treated so badly as, now Justice Kavanaugh. Well, I think she’ll have to make that decision. I don’t think she has any conflict at all. A Supreme Court judge does not have… They can make their own decision. They actually have additional power to make that decision. It would be totally up to her. I would think that she would be able to rule either for me or against me, being I don’t see any conflict whatsoever. We have an election coming up. I think it’s the most important election in the history of our country. If for any chance, and it probably won’t… And I hope it doesn’t ever get to the Supreme Court. But if it did, I would think that she would rule one way or the other. I would think so. I have no idea. Because believe it or not, I never asked her about it. I never talked about it. I didn’t talk about any of the obvious things that you could talk about. And I think a lot of people in my position might. But in speaking to a lot of very brilliant people and people that do this for a living, they say it’s better not to talk. So I talked to her about life. I talked to her about the fact, “Would you like to do this? Are you willing to do this?” Because it’s a tremendous burden. The answer was, “Yes.” She’s unbelievably well-qualified, but I never spoke to her about these various questions. Thank you very much. Well, again, I’m not ruling on this. And Roe v. Wade is something that a lot of people would say, obviously, you’re going to speak to somebody. Also two other great Justices, Justice Gorsuch, and Justice Kavanaugh… I never spoke to them about Roe v. Wade. I never spoke to them about election laws. I never spoke to them about anything. And I’ve done the right thing from a moral standpoint. I don’t even know from a legal standpoint, but it was the right thing. I think, depending on what happens with Roe v. Wade, I think that perhaps it could get sent down to the states, and the states would decide. I also think perhaps nothing will happen. I have not talked to her about it. I think it would be inappropriate to talk to her about it. And some people would say, “You can talk to about it.” I just think it would be inappropriate. I would like to see a brilliant jurist, a brilliant person who has done this in great depth and has actually skirted this issue for a long time, make a decision. And that’s why I chose her. I think that she’s going to make a great decision. I did not tell her what decision to make. And I think it would be inappropriate to say right now, because I don’t want to do anything to influence her. I want her to get approved, and then I want her to go by the law. And I know she’s going to make a great decision for our country, along with the other two people I put there. Many of them would. Perhaps most of them would. I am telling you, I don’t want to do anything to influence anything right now. I don’t want to go out tomorrow and say, “Oh, he’s trying to give her a signal.” Because I didn’t speak to her about it. I’ve done the right thing in so doing. How she’s going to rule, you’re going to find out perhaps. Or you might not find out. It may never get there. It may never get there. We’ll see what happens. Hi, Cindy. Thank you. Thank you very much. Right. I fully understand the question, and I saw everything that you saw over the summer. And it was a terrible thing, a terrible thing to watch. We have a Senator named Tim Scott from South Carolina. He came up with a bill that should have been approved. It was great. It was a bill that was strong in terms of law enforcement, and strong in terms of enforcing the proper thing, and doing the proper thing by law enforcement. And the Democrats just wouldn’t go for it. They wouldn’t go for it at all. And I don’t know why, because it was a really great bill. But I do have to say this. And some people don’t like it when I say it, but a lot of people agree. I have done more for the African American community than any president. With the exception of Abraham Lincoln. Criminal justice reform, prison reform, historically Black colleges and universities. I got them funded. They were on a year to year basis. They could have been put out of business. As soon as our country had a little bad year, they would have said, “I’m sorry, we’re not going to fund you.” I got them 10 year funding and financing. And more than they even asked for. I became very friendly with a lot of the heads. But we’ve done more… And of course, opportunity zones. But criminal justice reform, everybody said it could not be done. President Obama and Biden never even tried to do it. They never even tried. But I say that, and I say it often. I’ll say it loud, and I’m very proud of it. And I have a great relationship because of what I’ve done with the African-American community. I’m very proud of it. Thank you. Thank you very much. Got you. Thank you. Right. Yeah. DACA is somewhat different than Dreamers. You understand that, and you understand it better than anybody, probably, in this room. Where do you come from, by the way, originally? Where? That’s very good. Okay. So we are going to take care of DACA. We’re going to take care of Dreamer. It’s working right now. We’re negotiating different aspects of immigration and immigration law. We’ve built now, over 400 miles of border wall, southern border. Mexico is working very closely with us. We have the strongest border we’ve ever had. We want people to come into our country. They have to come in legally. But we are working very hard on the DACA program. And you will be, I think, very happy over the course of the next year. Because I feel the same way as you do about it. Thank you. Thank you very much. Well, what happens is because of the pandemic, much changed on the immigration front. Mexico is heavily infected, as you know. And we’ve made it very, very difficult to come in because of the pandemic, and other reasons, and crime. But we have a very strong border right now, and we have to keep it that way. But we want people to come into our country, but they have to come in through a merit system, and they have to come in legally. And people are very, very happy with it. You haven’t heard any complaints about that. But what happened is because of the pandemic, we have to be extra cautious. It’s very happy. The fact is, we got rid of catch and release, which is a disaster. You catch somebody. They could be a murderer. That could be a rapist, and we’re supposed to release them into our country. These are the laws that I inherited. We ended that program. Now, I think you’re going to see something very, very good. The whole immigration… If you look at what’s going on, people used to pour into our country. And especially during the pandemic, I think even you, Savannah, will be very impressed with what we’ve done. Sure. That’s right. Because I’ve done a great job. We have the strongest economy in the world. We closed it up. We are coming around the corner. The vaccines are coming out soon, and our economy is strong. We are at a level with jobs like we’ve never been before. We’ve rebuilt our military. We’ve rebuilt our borders. We had no borders. We had no nothing. We’ve rebuilt so much. We’ve given you the greatest tax cut in the history of our country. Greatest regulation cut, equally as important. And we created new levels of jobs that nobody thought was possible. And next year is going to be better than ever before. Thank you very much.'}"
